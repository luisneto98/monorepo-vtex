# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **VTEX DAY 26**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield project**

This is a custom-built platform designed specifically for the VTEX DAY 26 event, with no dependency on existing starter templates. The architecture will be designed from the ground up to meet the specific requirements of managing a large-scale corporate event with 20,000 participants.
