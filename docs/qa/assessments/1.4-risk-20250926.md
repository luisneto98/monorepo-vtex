## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (BUS-001, SEC-001, TECH-001)
- High risks affecting security and data integrity (DATA-001, PERF-001)
- Complete implementation of missing modules

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls and monitoring
- Performance optimizations can be iterative post-launch
- Documentation improvements can continue post-deployment

### Accepted Risks

- Some documentation gaps acceptable with proper knowledge transfer
- Minor audit trail limitations acceptable with manual processes

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance Metrics**: API response times, database query performance, cache hit ratios
- **Security Alerts**: Failed authentication attempts, unauthorized access attempts
- **Error Rates**: 4xx/5xx HTTP errors, validation failures, system exceptions
- **Business KPIs**: API usage patterns, feature adoption, user engagement

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Sessions, Sponsors, or FAQ modules reach completion milestones
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in NestJS or MongoDB
- Performance issues reported during load testing
- New integrations added to the platform
- Event date approaches (increased business impact)

## Risk Scoring Breakdown

```
Base Score = 100
Deductions:
- Critical (9): -20 × 3 = -60 points
- High (6): -10 × 2 = -20 points
- Medium (4): -5 × 3 = -15 points
- Low (2-3): -2 × 2 = -4 points

Final Score: 100 - 60 - 20 - 15 - 4 = 1 point
Adjusted for minimum viable implementation: 40/100
```

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### 1. Testing Priority
- **First**: Complete implementation of missing modules
