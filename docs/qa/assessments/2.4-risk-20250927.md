Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 15
- Critical Risks: 4
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 22/100 (Extremely High Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Mock File Upload Vulnerability
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Code shows mock upload implementation that creates blob URLs without server validation
**Impact**: High - Direct file system access, potential XSS/malware injection, no server-side scanning
**Mitigation**:
- Replace mock upload with secure server implementation immediately
- Implement server-side file type validation and malware scanning
- Use CDN/cloud storage instead of blob URLs
- Add Content Security Policy headers
**Testing Focus**: Penetration testing with malicious file uploads, XSS payload testing

### 2. TECH-001: Zero Test Coverage
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - No test files exist for any sponsor components
**Impact**: High - Unvalidated functionality, regression risks, no quality gates
**Mitigation**:
- Create comprehensive unit tests for all components (minimum 80% coverage)
- Add integration tests for API services
- Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with test gates
**Testing Focus**: Full test suite implementation before production

### 3. SEC-002: Client-Side Password Generation
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Password generation happens in browser environment
**Impact**: High - Weak entropy, predictable passwords, security breach risk
**Mitigation**:
- Move all password generation to server-side
- Use cryptographically secure random generators
- Implement password strength requirements
- Add multi-factor authentication
**Testing Focus**: Security audit of authentication flow

### 4. DATA-001: No Input Sanitization
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Client-side only validation, no server sanitization visible
**Impact**: High - SQL injection, XSS attacks, data corruption
**Mitigation**:
- Implement server-side input validation and sanitization
- Use parameterized queries/ORM protection
- Add HTML entity encoding for all outputs
- Validate all URLs and email formats server-side
**Testing Focus**: OWASP security testing, injection attack testing

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Security Metrics**
  - Failed login attempts
  - File upload errors/rejections
  - Suspicious input patterns
- **Performance Metrics**
  - API response times > 500ms
  - Memory usage trends
  - Image processing duration
- **Error Tracking**
  - Component render failures
  - API timeout rates
  - Validation error frequency
- **Business KPIs**
  - Sponsor account activation rate
  - Logo upload success rate

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Moving from mock to production file upload
- Implementing authentication changes
- Adding new sponsor management features
- Performance issues reported in production
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Before major version releases

## Risk Mitigation Timeline

### Immediate (Before Next Sprint)
1. Replace mock file upload with secure implementation
2. Add server-side input sanitization

## Risk-Based Recommendations

1. **Testing Priority**
   - Security testing must be completed first
   - No production deployment without test coverage
   - Penetration testing required before go-live

2. **Development Focus**
   - Replace all mock implementations immediately
   - Security-first approach for all changes
   - Code review with security checklist

3. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Staged rollout with limited sponsor access
   - Feature flags for high-risk components
   - Automated rollback on security alerts

4. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Real-time security alerts
   - Performance degradation warnings
   - File upload anomaly detection
   - Authentication failure tracking

## Integration with Quality Gates

**Gate Status: FAIL**
- 4 critical risks with score 9 → Automatic FAIL
- Zero test coverage → Blocks production deployment
- Security vulnerabilities → Requires immediate remediation

**Required for PASS**:
1. All critical risks mitigated
2. Minimum 80% test coverage achieved
3. Security audit completed and passed
4. Performance benchmarks met

## Key Principles Applied

- Early risk identification reveals critical security gaps
- Systematic scoring highlights deployment blockers
- Actionable mitigation paths provided for all risks
- Clear testing requirements linked to specific risks
- Residual risk tracking for informed decisions
- Continuous risk profile updates as story evolves
