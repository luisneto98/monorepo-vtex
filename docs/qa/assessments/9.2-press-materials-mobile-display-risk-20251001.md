# Risk Profile: Story 9.2 - Press Materials Mobile Display

**Generated**: 2025-10-01
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)
**Story**: 9.2 - Press Materials Display in Mobile App

## Executive Summary

**Overall Risk Level**: **LOW**

This is a low-risk, read-only feature that displays public press materials in the mobile app. The implementation follows proven patterns from the existing Sponsors feature, has comprehensive unit tests, and includes no authentication, payment, or data modification logic. Primary risks are around file download UX and mobile data consumption, both of which are mitigated with large file warnings and browser-based downloads.

## Risk Matrix

| Risk Area | Probability | Impact | Score | Severity | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|--------|-------|----------|------------|
| **Large File Downloads** | Medium (3) | Medium (3) | 9 | Medium | ✓ Large file warnings (>50MB), opens in device browser, user confirmation required |
| **Offline Cache Staleness** | Low (2) | Low (2) | 4 | Low | ✓ 10-minute TTL, pull-to-refresh, stale-while-revalidate pattern |
| **Missing Component Tests** | Medium (3) | Low (2) | 6 | Low | ⚠ Excellent service tests exist, recommend adding UI tests in future sprint |
| **Hardcoded Localization** | Low (2) | Low (2) | 4 | Low | ✓ Documented in code with TODOs, acceptable for MVP |
| **Backend Dependency** | Low (1) | Medium (3) | 3 | Low | ✓ Public endpoint with graceful error handling, cache fallback |
| **Download Link Expiry** | Low (1) | Low (2) | 2 | Low | ✓ Backend generates fresh signed URLs on demand |

**Risk Scoring**: Probability × Impact (1-3 scale each, max 9)
**Severity Thresholds**: ≥9 = High, 6-8 = Medium, ≤5 = Low

## Detailed Risk Assessment

### 1. Large File Downloads (Score: 9, Medium)

**Description**: Users may attempt to download large press kit files (videos, high-res images) over mobile connections, causing unexpected data usage, long wait times, or app crashes.

**Probability**: Medium (3/3) - Press materials often include multi-megabyte files

**Impact**: Medium (3/3) - Poor user experience, potential data overage charges

**Mitigation Status**: ✓ **Mitigated**
- Large file warning (>50MB) with confirmation dialog before download
- Files open in device browser/viewer (via Linking API) instead of in-app download
- File size displayed prominently in UI
- Download button shows clear loading state

**Residual Risk**: Low - Users are warned and must explicitly confirm

---

### 2. Offline Cache Staleness (Score: 4, Low)

**Description**: Cached press materials may become outdated if new materials are published or existing ones are updated.

**Probability**: Low (2/3) - Press materials don't change frequently during events

**Impact**: Low (2/3) - Users see slightly outdated info, correctable via refresh

**Mitigation Status**: ✓ **Mitigated**
- 10-minute cache TTL balances freshness with performance
- Pull-to-refresh explicitly clears cache and fetches fresh data
- Stale-while-revalidate pattern: shows cached data immediately, updates in background
- Cache invalidation on explicit refresh

**Residual Risk**: Minimal - Cache is short-lived and user-controllable

---

### 3. Missing Component Tests (Score: 6, Low)

**Description**: No React Native Testing Library tests for UI components (PressMaterialsListScreen and PressMaterialDetailModal), only service-level tests exist.

**Probability**: Medium (3/3) - Component tests are missing

**Impact**: Low (2/3) - Service tests provide good coverage, but UI regressions may slip through

**Mitigation Status**: ⚠ **Partially Mitigated**
- Excellent service-level unit tests (22 tests, all passing)
- UI follows proven patterns from Sponsors feature (reduces risk)
- Manual testing on simulators planned (per Definition of Done)
- Recommendation: Add component tests in future sprint

**Residual Risk**: Low - Not blocking for MVP, but should be addressed

---

### 4. Hardcoded Localization (Score: 4, Low)

**Description**: User-facing strings are hardcoded in Portuguese instead of using a centralized i18n solution. TODOs exist in code noting this.

**Probability**: Low (2/3) - Current implementation works for pt-BR users

**Impact**: Low (2/3) - English/Spanish users see Portuguese strings (minor UX issue)

**Mitigation Status**: ✓ **Documented**
- Backend provides localized content (pt, en, es) via API
- Service includes `getLocalizedString()` method ready for i18n integration
- TODOs in code mark areas needing i18n
- Shared types support multi-language
- Acceptable for MVP - i18n infrastructure doesn't exist yet

**Residual Risk**: Minimal - Technical debt documented, easy to fix when i18n infrastructure added

---

### 5. Backend Dependency (Score: 3, Low)

**Description**: Mobile app depends on backend `/press-materials/public` endpoint. If backend is down or slow, users can't access press materials.

**Probability**: Low (1/3) - Backend is generally reliable

**Impact**: Medium (3/3) - Feature unavailable if backend fails

**Mitigation Status**: ✓ **Mitigated**
- Graceful error handling with clear user-facing messages
- Fallback to stale cache if backend request fails
- Pull-to-refresh allows users to retry
- ErrorState component provides retry button
- Public endpoint requires no authentication (reduces failure points)

**Residual Risk**: Low - Standard API dependency with good error handling

---

### 6. Download Link Expiry (Score: 2, Low)

**Description**: Signed download URLs from S3 could expire if user delays clicking download, or device goes offline mid-download.

**Probability**: Low (1/3) - Users typically download immediately

**Impact**: Low (2/3) - User sees error, can retry

**Mitigation Status**: ✓ **Mitigated**
- Backend generates fresh signed URL on each download request
- Download tracking endpoint called immediately before opening URL
- Clear error messages if download fails
- User can easily retry download

**Residual Risk**: Minimal - Standard pattern with good error handling

---

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Service Layer: ✓ Excellent (22 tests)
- API calls with/without cache
- Error handling (404, 500, network errors)
- Cache fallback on errors
- Download tracking
- Localization logic
- Grouping and filtering
- All edge cases covered

### Component Layer: ⚠ Missing
- No React Native Testing Library tests for screens
- Recommendation: Add in future sprint (not blocking)

### Integration Layer: ⚠ Missing
- No end-to-end navigation flow tests
- Manual testing planned per Definition of Done

---

## Security Assessment

**Security Risk Level**: **VERY LOW**

- ✓ Public endpoint (no authentication bypass risk)
- ✓ No sensitive data handled
- ✓ No payment processing
- ✓ No user data modification
- ✓ Read-only operations only
- ✓ Download tracking properly logs without exposing data
- ✓ React Native handles content escaping (no XSS risk)
- ✓ Large file warnings protect against DoS-style data consumption

**Security Recommendation**: None - security posture is appropriate for public read-only content.

---

## Performance Assessment

**Performance Risk Level**: **LOW**

- ✓ Stale-while-revalidate caching provides instant UI
- ✓ 10-minute TTL reduces API load
- ✓ Images lazy-load with placeholders
- ✓ Downloads handled by device browser (doesn't block app)
- ✓ No n+1 query problems (single API call for listing)

**Performance Recommendation**: None - performance strategy is sound.

---

## Recommendations

### Must Fix Before Production
*None* - All critical issues addressed

### Should Address Soon (Next Sprint)
1. Add React Native Testing Library tests for PressMaterialsListScreen
2. Add React Native Testing Library tests for PressMaterialDetailModal
3. Complete manual testing on iOS/Android simulators (per Definition of Done)

### Consider for Future
1. Implement centralized i18n solution when mobile app adds multi-language support
2. Implement logging service to replace console statements
3. Add integration tests for navigation flow: Home → Press Materials → Detail → Download

---

## Conclusion

**Gate Decision**: **PASS**

Story 9.2 presents **low overall risk** with excellent mitigation strategies. The implementation follows proven patterns, has comprehensive service-level tests, and includes thoughtful UX features (large file warnings, offline support, clear error messages). The identified medium-risk issue (large file downloads) is well-mitigated with user warnings and browser-based downloads.

Missing component tests and hardcoded strings are documented technical debt suitable for future sprints and do not block production deployment for MVP.

**Deployment Recommendation**: Proceed to production after completing manual simulator testing (per Definition of Done).
