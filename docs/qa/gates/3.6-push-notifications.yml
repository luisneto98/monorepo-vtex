# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Deep link validation with allowlist patterns, content sanitization prevents XSS, backend encryption (AES-256-GCM), proper public endpoint configuration for visitor mode device registration"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimized caching strategy with TTL (1h-6h), LRU eviction at 10MB limit, 2-second debounce on reconnection, AsyncStorage batching, React Native compatibility (Buffer.byteLength), exponential backoff for retries"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling across all services, 77 tests validate critical paths (cache expiry/eviction, network transitions, retry queue, storage failures, race conditions, notification persistence)"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture with separation of concerns, TypeScript type safety, comprehensive documentation, follows established project patterns, excellent test coverage enables safe refactoring"

# Final verdict
verdict:
  status: APPROVED_FOR_PRODUCTION
  confidence: HIGH
  notes: |
    Exceptional implementation quality. All 6 acceptance criteria fully met with comprehensive
    test coverage (77 tests, 93-97% service coverage). Security measures properly implemented
    (deep link validation, content sanitization, encryption). Performance optimized for mobile
    (caching, debouncing, React Native compatibility). This story demonstrates best practices
    and should serve as a model for future development. Development team's response to QA
    feedback was exemplary. Ready for immediate production deployment.
