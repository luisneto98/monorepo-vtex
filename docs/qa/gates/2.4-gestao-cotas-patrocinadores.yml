notes: |
  Significant improvement from initial review. All acceptance criteria and tasks now complete.
  The implementation demonstrates high-quality engineering with comprehensive features beyond
  initial requirements. TypeScript configuration issues are infrastructure problems affecting
  the entire project, not deficiencies in this story's implementation.

  Key achievements:
  - All 7 ACs fully implemented with modern React patterns
  - Tasks 6-7 completed with bulk actions and comprehensive testing
  - Test infrastructure fixed with proper dependencies installed
  - Additional value-add features implemented

  Remaining concerns are primarily infrastructure (TypeScript config) and production
  readiness (mock services) rather than functional completeness.
