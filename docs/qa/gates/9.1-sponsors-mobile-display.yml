# NFR Validation Assessment
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "✅ Critical issue resolved: isVisible now excluded. Remaining: No rate limiting (OPS-001 - medium), field pattern consistency (TECH-001 - medium)"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "✅ Composite index added for optimized queries. Expected <100ms p95 for 1000+ sponsors"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling comprehensive, mobile service has stale-while-revalidate pattern, cache fallback implemented"
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Inconsistent field exclusion patterns (TECH-001). Recommend centralized PUBLIC_SPONSOR_SELECT constant for future maintenance"
  usability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Locale detection incomplete (BUS-001). English users see Portuguese tier names - non-blocking UX improvement"

# Positive Findings (What Works Well)
strengths:
  - "Mobile service unit tests comprehensive (293 lines, all scenarios covered) - DATA-001 resolved"
  - "Integration tests verify sensitive field exclusion for maxPosts, postsUsed, adminEmail"
  - "Error handling robust with proper transformation and stale cache fallback"
  - "Stale-while-revalidate caching pattern implemented correctly"
  - "Swagger documentation complete for all new endpoints"
  - "Public decorator (@Public()) correctly applied for unauthenticated access"
  - "Logo upload has proper rate limiting (5 req/min) and security checks"

# Testing Gaps
testing_gaps:
  missing_tests:
    - "Security test to verify isVisible is NOT in public API response"
    - "Load test with 1000+ sponsors to validate performance"
    - "Query execution plan verification (explain() command)"
    - "E2E deep linking tests (manual testing completed)"

  test_quality_issues:
    - "Integration tests ASSERT isVisible presence instead of exclusion (lines 131,227)"
    - "No performance benchmarking tests"
    - "No security penetration tests for enumeration attacks"
