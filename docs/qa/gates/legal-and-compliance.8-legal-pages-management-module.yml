    notes: 'Excellent multi-layered security with ClamAV virus scanning, PDF validation, malicious pattern detection, JWT auth, rate limiting. Minor: quarantine not physically implemented.'
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Missing caching layer and CDN configuration could impact <200ms response time at scale. Database queries lack pagination.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Robust error handling, proper transaction safety, graceful degradation when ClamAV unavailable.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean architecture with good separation of concerns. Test coverage needs improvement but code structure is excellent.'
