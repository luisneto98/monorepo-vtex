# Quality Gate Decision - Story 2.8
schema: 1
story: "2.8"
story_title: "Speaker Photo Upload with Centralized Storage"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation is solid and meets all acceptance criteria. Minor linting issues fixed during review. Lacks comprehensive test coverage for storage module - unit tests not found for StorageService, VirusScannerService, and speaker upload endpoint."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Strong security implementation: JWT auth, role-based access, file type validation with magic bytes, virus scanning integration, rate limiting (5/min), input sanitization. AWS credentials properly accessed via ConfigService."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient implementation: streaming to S3, magic bytes check reads only first 16 bytes, single MongoDB update per upload. S3 and Redis support horizontal scaling."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Good error handling with proper NestJS exceptions. However, lack of tests creates risk for regression. DeleteFile swallows errors which is intentional but should be monitored."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization: well-structured Storage module, clear separation of concerns, comprehensive documentation, proper TypeScript types, consistent NestJS patterns. Successful migration of legal-pages and press-materials demonstrates reusability."
