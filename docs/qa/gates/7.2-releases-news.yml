notes: |
  The News Releases module demonstrates mature security practices with defense-in-depth approach.
  The implementation exceeds expectations with comprehensive protection layers including:
  - XSS prevention through strict DOMPurify configuration
  - Multi-layer path traversal protection
  - Strategic rate limiting per endpoint type
  - Comprehensive test coverage (957 lines of security/integration tests)

  The identified issues are moderate severity and do not block production deployment.
  Recommend addressing the file upload and search regex issues in the next sprint.

  This module sets a high bar for security implementation in the project.
