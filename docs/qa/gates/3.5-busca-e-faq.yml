nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent XSS protection with HTML sanitization in RichTextRenderer. Event handlers stripped, script/iframe tags removed. Input validation properly implemented.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Good performance optimizations: React.memo usage, FlatList virtualization, 5-minute cache with TTL, debounced search (300ms), lazy loading support'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Proper error handling throughout. View count tracking fails gracefully without breaking UX. Cache invalidation and retry logic implemented correctly. Fixed critical bug in FaqCategories where non-array API response caused runtime crash - now has defensive Array.isArray() checks.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean architecture with separation of concerns. Service layer properly abstracts API calls. Components are well-structured and follow React best practices.'
