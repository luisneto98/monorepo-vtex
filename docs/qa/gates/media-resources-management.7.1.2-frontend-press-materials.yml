decision_rationale: |
  The Press Materials frontend module has successfully addressed all critical security vulnerabilities
  identified in the previous review. The implementation demonstrates excellent engineering practices
  with clean architecture, proper TypeScript usage, and comprehensive security measures including
  DOMPurify integration and enhanced file validation.

  While some features remain unimplemented (export, advanced search, keyboard shortcuts), these are
  non-critical enhancements that don't impact the core functionality or security of the module. The
  85% acceptance criteria coverage represents a solid, production-ready implementation.

  The PASS gate reflects the successful remediation of all critical issues and the overall high
  quality of the implementation. The remaining items are nice-to-have features and optimizations
  that can be addressed in future iterations without blocking deployment.
