fixed_issues:
  - issue: 'Critical authentication token mismatch'

    line: 29
    fix: "Changed localStorage.getItem('token') to localStorage.getItem('access_token')"
    impact: 'HIGH - Would have caused authentication failures in production'

notes: |
  The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with good architectural patterns.
  A critical authentication bug was discovered and fixed during review. The remaining issues
  are minor and don't block deployment but should be addressed for production readiness.
  The team has done excellent work on the multilingual support and image upload functionality.
