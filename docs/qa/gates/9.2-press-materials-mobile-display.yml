# Refactoring completed during review
refactoring_performed:
  - file: "apps/mobile/src/screens/Home/HomeScreen.tsx"
    change: "Replaced useNavigation<any>() with proper TypeScript typing using NativeStackNavigationProp<RootStackParamList>"
    why: "The any type defeats TypeScript's type safety and can lead to runtime navigation errors"
    impact: "Improved type safety, better IDE autocomplete, compile-time navigation error detection"
