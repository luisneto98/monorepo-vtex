## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Stories 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3:
- All schemas created with proper structure and indexes
- Basic services and controllers exist in `apps/api/src/modules/*/`
- JWT authentication configured with guards
- MongoDB schemas have multilingual support and relationships

### API Endpoint Specifications [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

```
GET /speakers - List all visible speakers
GET /speakers/:id - Get speaker details
GET /sessions - List all sessions with filters
GET /sessions/:id - Get session details
GET /sponsors - List sponsors grouped by tier
GET /sponsors/:id - Get sponsor details
GET /faq/categories - List FAQ categories
GET /faq - List FAQs with filters
```

#### Admin Endpoints (Auth Required)
```
POST /speakers - Create new speaker
PATCH /speakers/:id - Update speaker
DELETE /speakers/:id - Soft delete speaker

POST /sessions - Create new session
PATCH /sessions/:id - Update session
DELETE /sessions/:id - Soft delete session

POST /sponsors - Create new sponsor
PATCH /sponsors/:id - Update sponsor
DELETE /sponsors/:id - Soft delete sponsor

POST /sponsors/tiers - Create sponsor tier
PATCH /sponsors/tiers/:id - Update tier
DELETE /sponsors/tiers/:id - Delete tier

POST /faq/categories - Create FAQ category
PATCH /faq/categories/:id - Update category
DELETE /faq/categories/:id - Delete category

POST /faq - Create FAQ
PATCH /faq/:id - Update FAQ
DELETE /faq/:id - Soft delete FAQ
```

### Standard Response Format
```typescript
// Success Response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": T | T[],
  "metadata": {
    "total": number,
    "page": number,
    "limit": number,
    "hasNext": boolean,
    "hasPrev": boolean
  }
}

// Error Response (from GlobalExceptionFilter)
{
  "error": {
    "code": string,
    "message": string,
    "details": any,
    "timestamp": string,
    "requestId": string
  }
}
```

### Pagination Implementation
```typescript
// Query params
?page=1&limit=20&sort=-createdAt,name&search=keyword

// PaginationDto
class PaginationDto {
  @IsOptional()
  @Type(() => Number)
  @IsInt()
  @Min(1)
  page?: number = 1;

  @IsOptional()
  @Type(() => Number)
  @IsInt()
  @Min(1)
  @Max(100)
  limit?: number = 20;

  @IsOptional()
  @IsString()
  sort?: string; // "-createdAt,name" for DESC by createdAt, ASC by name

  @IsOptional()
  @IsString()
  search?: string;
}
```

### Complex Filtering Examples
```typescript
// Sessions filtering
GET /sessions?startDate=2025-11-26&endDate=2025-11-28&stage=principal&tags=AI,B2B&speakerId=123

// Sponsors filtering by tier
GET /sponsors?tier=diamond&tags=technology,saas

// FAQ search
GET /faq?category=general&search=ingresso&lang=pt-BR
```

### Soft Delete Implementation
Schemas that need soft delete:
- Speaker - Keep for historical reference
- Session - Keep for analytics
- Sponsor - Keep for billing/history
- FAQ - Keep for audit trail
- User - Keep for compliance

Add to schemas:
```typescript
deletedAt: { type: Date, default: null, index: true }
deletedBy: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }
deleteReason: { type: String }
```

### DTO Examples for Validation
```typescript
// CreateSpeakerDto
export class CreateSpeakerDto {
  @IsString()
  @MinLength(3)
  @MaxLength(100)
  name: string;

  @ValidateNested()
  @Type(() => MultilingualTextDto)
  bio: MultilingualTextDto;

  @IsUrl()
  photoUrl: string;

  @IsString()
  @MaxLength(100)
  company: string;

  @ValidateNested()
  @Type(() => MultilingualTextDto)
  position: MultilingualTextDto;

  @IsOptional()
  @ValidateNested()
  @Type(() => SocialLinksDto)
  socialLinks?: SocialLinksDto;

  @IsOptional()
  @IsBoolean()
  isHighlight?: boolean;
}
```

### Service Method Patterns
```typescript
// Standard service methods
class SpeakersService {
  async findAll(paginationDto: PaginationDto, filters?: FilterDto): Promise<PaginatedResponse<Speaker>>;
  async findOne(id: string): Promise<Speaker>;
  async create(createDto: CreateSpeakerDto): Promise<Speaker>;
  async update(id: string, updateDto: UpdateSpeakerDto): Promise<Speaker>;
  async remove(id: string, userId: string, reason?: string): Promise<void>;
  async restore(id: string): Promise<Speaker>;
}
```

### Authorization Guards
Apply guards in controllers:
```typescript
@Controller('speakers')
export class SpeakersController {
  @Get()
  @Public() // No auth needed
  findAll() {}

  @Post()
  @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
  @Roles('super_admin', 'producer')
  create() {}
}
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Test Structure [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests: `apps/api/tests/unit/modules/*/services/`
- Integration tests: `apps/api/tests/integration/*/`
- E2E tests: `apps/api/tests/e2e/`

#### Required Test Coverage
1. **Service Tests**: All CRUD operations, pagination logic, filtering
2. **Controller Tests**: Request/response handling, guards, validation
3. **Integration Tests**: Full API flow with database
4. **E2E Tests**: Complete user journeys

### Performance Considerations
- Use MongoDB aggregation for complex queries
- Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data (speakers, sponsors)
- Add indexes for all filter fields
- Limit default page size to 20 items
- Use projection to return only needed fields

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation: PARTIALLY COMPLETE (25%)**

The Speaker module demonstrates excellent implementation quality with comprehensive CRUD operations, proper validation, pagination, filtering, and soft delete functionality. However, only 1 of 4 required modules has been fully implemented. The Sessions, Sponsors, and FAQ modules remain incomplete with basic scaffolding but missing critical functionality.

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: HIGH** - Story marked as APPROVED but 75% of acceptance criteria unmet. This triggers deep review due to:
- Incomplete implementation (3/4 modules not done)
- Missing tests for majority of functionality
- Security concerns with `any` types in incomplete modules
- > 5 acceptance criteria in story

### Requirements Traceability

  - Given: Admin accesses speakers API
  - When: Performing CRUD operations
  - Then: All operations work with proper authorization
- **AC2 (Pagination/filtering)**: ✅ Fully implemented
  - Given: User requests speaker list
  - When: Applying pagination and filters
  - Then: Results are paginated and filtered correctly
- **AC3 (Response format)**: ✅ Standardized responses
  - Given: Any API request
  - When: Response is returned
