# User Story: Backend API for Press Materials

## Story
**As a** marketing team member
**I want** a complete backend API for managing press materials
**So that** journalists and partners can access official event media resources

## Background
The VTEX Day 2026 platform needs a centralized system for managing press materials including press kits, logo packages, event photos, institutional videos, and presentations. This story implements the backend API module following existing patterns from modules like `speakers` and `event-settings`.

## Acceptance Criteria

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-28
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)
**Review Type:** Comprehensive Risk-Aware Review
**Gate Decision:** PASS WITH CONCERNS

### QA Fix Implementation: 2025-09-28
**Developer:** James (Dev)
**Status:** COMPLETED

### Executive Summary
The Press Materials module implementation is technically complete and functional. All acceptance criteria have been met, with comprehensive CRUD operations, file management, and security controls. However, there are notable concerns regarding input sanitization, rate limiting implementation, and some edge case handling that should be addressed in follow-up work.

### Requirements Traceability
✅ **API Endpoints** - All 8 required endpoints implemented
✅ **Data Model** - Complete schema with multilingual support
✅ **File Management** - S3 integration with validation and thumbnails
✅ **Business Rules** - Publication status, file validation, download tracking
✅ **Security** - JWT authentication, role-based access control

### Test Coverage Analysis
#### Unit Tests (PASS)
- Service layer: Well-structured mocks, core functionality covered
- Controller endpoints: Request/response validation tested
- File upload scenarios: Format and size validation covered
- Coverage: Estimated >80% based on test structure

#### Integration Tests (PASS)
- All CRUD operations tested with authentication
- File upload and download workflows validated
- Error scenarios and edge cases included
- Public/restricted access properly tested

### Security Assessment (CONCERNS)
#### Strengths
✅ JWT authentication properly implemented
✅ Role-based access control (ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN)
✅ Signed URLs for restricted content (24-hour expiry)
✅ File type and size validation

#### Concerns
⚠️ **Input Sanitization**: No explicit HTML/script sanitization in title/description fields
⚠️ **Rate Limiting**: Controller has rate limiting decorator but implementation not verified
⚠️ **Path Traversal**: File key extraction could benefit from additional validation
⚠️ **Error Information**: Some error messages might leak internal structure

### Non-Functional Requirements (PARTIAL)
#### Performance (PASS)
- Pagination implemented with configurable limits
- Database indexes on searchable fields
- Efficient S3 streaming for large files

#### Scalability (CONCERNS)
⚠️ Thumbnail generation is synchronous - could block for large images
⚠️ No caching layer for frequently accessed materials
⚠️ Missing CDN integration for global distribution

#### Reliability (PASS)
- Error handling in all service methods
- Graceful S3 failure handling
- Transaction-like behavior for create/delete operations

### Risk Assessment
#### High Risk Items (NONE)
No critical security vulnerabilities or data loss risks identified

#### Medium Risk Items
1. **Missing Input Sanitization** (Security)
   - Impact: XSS vulnerability in admin panel
   - Likelihood: Medium
   - Mitigation: Add DOMPurify or similar sanitization

2. **Synchronous Thumbnail Generation** (Performance)
   - Impact: Request timeout for large files
   - Likelihood: Low-Medium
   - Mitigation: Queue-based async processing

3. **No Rate Limiting Verification** (Security)
   - Impact: Potential DoS on download endpoint
   - Likelihood: Low
   - Mitigation: Implement and test rate limiting

#### Low Risk Items
- Missing CDN integration (Performance)
- No virus scanning on uploads (Security)
- Limited monitoring/alerting (Operations)

### Code Quality Assessment
#### Strengths
✅ Clean module structure following NestJS patterns
✅ Proper separation of concerns
✅ Comprehensive DTO validation
✅ Good test organization

#### Improvements Needed
- Add input sanitization utilities
- Implement caching strategy
- Add performance monitoring
- Document S3 bucket configuration

### Recommendations
#### Must Fix (Before Production)
1. Implement HTML/script sanitization for text fields
2. Verify and test rate limiting implementation
3. Add path traversal protection in file operations

#### Should Fix (Next Sprint)
1. Implement async thumbnail generation with queues
2. Add Redis caching for frequently accessed materials
3. Integrate CDN for global content delivery
4. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

#### Consider (Future)
1. Virus scanning for uploaded files
2. Watermarking for photos
3. Advanced analytics dashboard
4. Backup strategy documentation

### Testing Gaps
- Load testing for concurrent uploads
- Security penetration testing
- Cross-browser file upload testing
- S3 failover scenarios

### Quality Gate Decision: PASS WITH CONCERNS
The implementation meets all functional requirements and follows good architectural patterns. Core security controls are in place. However, the identified security concerns (input sanitization, rate limiting) should be addressed before production deployment. The module is approved for development/staging environments with the requirement to address "Must Fix" items before production release.

### Follow-up Actions Required
1. ~~Create tickets for "Must Fix" security items~~ ✅ Fixed in code
2. Schedule performance testing for file uploads
3. Document S3 bucket configuration and IAM policies
4. Plan async thumbnail generation implementation

### QA Fixes Applied

#### Security Enhancements Completed
1. **Input Sanitization** ✅
   - Created `SanitizationUtil` class with DOMPurify integration
   - Applied sanitization to all text input fields (title, description, tags)
   - Protected against XSS vulnerabilities in multilingual fields
   - Sanitized search queries to prevent regex injection

2. **Rate Limiting Implementation** ✅
   - Verified global rate limiting (100 requests/minute)
   - Added specific limits for critical endpoints:
     - Download: 10 requests/minute per IP
     - Upload/Create: 5 requests/minute
   - Using NestJS Throttler module for robust implementation

3. **Path Traversal Protection** ✅
   - Added `sanitizeFilePath` utility function
   - Applied to all file operations (upload, delete, URL extraction)
   - Removes dangerous characters and path navigation attempts
   - Validates file keys before S3 operations

#### Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed UserRole enum references (SUPER_ADMIN, PRODUCER)
- Fixed TypeScript import issues
- Resolved ESLint warnings
- Updated test file imports

#### Files Modified
- Created: `apps/api/src/common/utils/sanitization.util.ts`
- Updated: `press-materials.service.ts` (sanitization integration)
- Updated: `file-upload.service.ts` (path traversal protection)
- Updated: `press-materials.controller.ts` (rate limiting, role fixes)
- Updated: Test files for proper imports

#### Remaining Actions (Next Sprint)
1. Implement async thumbnail generation with queues
2. Add Redis caching for frequently accessed materials
3. Integrate CDN for global content delivery
4. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
