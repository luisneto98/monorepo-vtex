        filename: String,
        originalName: String,
        size: Number,
        uploadedAt: Date,
        uploadedBy: String
      },
      en: {
        filename: String,
        originalName: String,
        size: Number,

        size: Number,
        uploadedAt: Date,
        uploadedBy: String
      }
    }
  })
  files: {
    pt?: FileMetadata;
    en?: FileMetadata;
    es?: FileMetadata;
  };

  @Prop({
    type: {
      pt: String,
      en: String,
      es: String
    },
    required: true
  })
  title: LocalizedString;

  @Prop()
  lastModifiedBy: string;

  @Prop({ default: true })
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

### File Upload Configuration
```typescript
// Multer configuration
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: './uploads/legal-pages',
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9);
    cb(null, `${file.fieldname}-${uniqueSuffix}.pdf`);
  }
});

const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  if (file.mimetype === 'application/pdf') {
    cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb(new Error('Only PDF files are allowed'), false);
  }
};

const upload = multer({
  storage,
  fileFilter,
  limits: { fileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024 } // 10MB
});
```

### Testing Standards
- Test files: Adjacent to source (*.spec.ts, *.test.tsx)
- Minimum coverage: 80% for all new code
- File upload tests with mock files
- Validation tests for file types and sizes

### Security Implementation
1. **File type validation - PDF only**

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The Legal Pages module implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with comprehensive feature delivery. The module successfully implements a PDF-based legal document management system with multilingual support and proper security controls. The architecture follows NestJS best practices with clean separation of concerns, proper dependency injection, and modular organization.

### Architecture Compliance Issues Identified

**Critical Issue - Storage Non-Compliance:**
- **Finding**: Using local filesystem storage (`./uploads/legal-pages`) instead of AWS S3 as specified in tech-stack.md
- **Impact**: Production scalability, data persistence, and CDN integration issues
- **Recommendation**: Migrate to AWS S3 for file storage before production deployment

**Medium Issue - Type Sharing Non-Compliance:**
- **Finding**: Types defined locally in module instead of packages/shared as per coding-standards.md
- **Impact**: Type reusability and consistency across applications
- **Recommendation**: Extract common types (SupportedLanguage, FileMetadata, LegalPageType) to packages/shared

### Compliance Check

### Review Date: 2025-09-29 (Comprehensive Re-Review)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The Legal Pages module demonstrates **excellent overall implementation quality** with robust security practices, proper AWS S3 integration, and comprehensive virus scanning capabilities. The architecture follows NestJS best practices with clean separation of concerns. The implementation successfully addresses the previous review's critical concerns about storage compliance and security. Minor type sharing issues remain that need addressing.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/api/src/modules/legal-pages/dto/create-legal-page.dto.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed type import to use shared package instead of local schema
  - **Why**: Compliance with coding-standards.md requiring shared types in packages/shared
  - **How**: Changed import from '../schemas/legal-page.schema' to '@vtexday26/shared'

- **File**: apps/api/src/modules/legal-pages/dto/create-legal-page.dto.ts
  - **Change**: Removed unused 'language' field
  - **Why**: Field was not used in implementation and added unnecessary complexity
  - **How**: Deleted the field and its validation decorators

- **File**: apps/api/src/modules/legal-pages/dto/update-legal-page.dto.ts
  - **Change**: Removed unused 'language' field and unused import
  - **Why**: Field was not used and import was flagged as unused by TypeScript
  - **How**: Deleted the field and removed IsString from imports

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Types now properly shared via packages/shared
- Project Structure: ✓ Module structure follows NestJS patterns excellently
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Frontend tests have mismatched expectations, need updates
- All ACs Met: ✓ All functional requirements properly implemented
