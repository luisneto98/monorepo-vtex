### Backend Integration Context

#### Story 2.7 - Push Notifications Backend
The backend notification system is already implemented with the following capabilities:
- **Device Registration Endpoint**: `POST /notifications/devices/register`
  - Accepts: `{ token: string, platform: 'ios' | 'android', appVersion?: string, isTestDevice: boolean }`
  - Returns device registration confirmation
- **Notification Payload Structure**:
  ```typescript
  interface Notification {
    _id: ObjectId;
    title: string; // Max 65 characters
    message: string; // Max 240 characters
    scheduledAt?: Date;
    sentAt?: Date;
    status: 'draft' | 'scheduled' | 'sending' | 'sent' | 'failed';
    metadata?: Record<string, any>; // Deep link data, action types
  }
  ```
- **Device Token Encryption**: Backend encrypts tokens at rest using AES-256-GCM
- **Rate Limiting**: Backend has notification throttling (10/hour per admin)
- **Security**: Input sanitization and XSS prevention implemented server-side
[Source: docs/stories/2.7.story.md#data-models]

### Data Models

#### Device Token Registration
```typescript
interface DeviceRegistration {
  token: string; // FCM or APNS token from device
  platform: 'ios' | 'android';
  appVersion?: string; // App version for debugging
  userId?: string; // Optional - for authenticated users only (Phase 2)
  isTestDevice: boolean; // For admin test notifications
}
```

#### Notification Payload (Received from Backend)
```typescript
interface PushNotification {
  id: string;
  title: string; // Max 65 chars
  message: string; // Max 240 chars
  timestamp: Date;
  read: boolean; // Local state only
  metadata?: {
    type?: 'session_update' | 'general' | 'reminder';
    deepLink?: string; // e.g., "vtexevents://session/123"
    sessionId?: string;
    speakerId?: string;
  };
}
```

#### Cached Data Structure
```typescript
interface CacheEntry<T> {
  data: T;
  timestamp: number; // Unix timestamp
  ttl: number; // Time to live in milliseconds
}

interface CacheKeys {
  '@cache_sessions': CacheEntry<Session[]>;
  '@cache_speakers': CacheEntry<Speaker[]>;
  '@cache_faq': CacheEntry<FAQ[]>;
  '@cache_sponsors': CacheEntry<Sponsor[]>;
  '@notifications_unread': PushNotification[];
  '@notification_permission_status': 'granted' | 'denied' | 'undetermined';
}
```

### API Specifications

#### Device Registration
- **Endpoint**: `POST /notifications/devices/register`
- **Auth**: Not required (public endpoint for visitor mode)
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "token": "ExponentPushToken[...]",
    "platform": "ios",
    "appVersion": "1.0.0",
    "isTestDevice": false
  }
  ```
- **Response**: `{ success: boolean, deviceId: string }`
[Source: apps/api/src/modules/notifications/notifications.controller.ts]

#### Notification Payload (Received via FCM/APNS)
- **Title**: Max 65 characters
- **Body**: Max 240 characters
- **Data**: JSON object with optional deep link and metadata
- **Badge**: Integer for unread count (handled client-side)

### Component Specifications

#### File Locations
Based on existing mobile app structure:
- **Services**: `apps/mobile/src/services/`
  - NotificationService.ts - Handle push notification logic
  - CacheService.ts - Manage AsyncStorage caching with TTL
  - SyncService.ts - Background data synchronization
- **Contexts**: `apps/mobile/src/contexts/`
  - NetworkContext.tsx - Global network state management
  - NotificationContext.tsx - Notification state and badge count
- **Components**: `apps/mobile/src/components/`
  - notifications/NotificationBanner.tsx - In-app notification display
  - notifications/NotificationsList.tsx - View all notifications
  - common/OfflineIndicator.tsx - Network status banner
- **Screens**: `apps/mobile/src/screens/`
  - Onboarding/OnboardingScreen.tsx - Initial permission request
  - Settings/NotificationsScreen.tsx - Notification list and settings
- **Utils**: `apps/mobile/src/utils/`
  - cache.utils.ts - Cache key management and helpers
  - notification.utils.ts - Notification parsing and formatting
[Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Technical Constraints

#### Push Notifications
- Use **Expo Notifications** for simplified setup (recommended for this project)
  - Supports both iOS and Android with single API
  - Handles permissions, tokens, and notification display
  - Works with Expo Go during development
  - Alternative: @react-native-firebase/messaging for native builds
- **Permission Timing**: Request on onboarding, not on app launch (better UX)
- **Token Management**: Register token immediately after permission granted
- **Token Refresh**: Re-register token on app updates or token refresh events
- **Notification Categories**: Support actionable notifications (Phase 2)
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md - React Native ecosystem]

#### Offline Storage
- **AsyncStorage Limits**: ~6MB on Android, ~10MB on iOS (stay under 5MB total)
- **Cache Strategy**: Stale-while-revalidate for best UX
  - Show cached data immediately
  - Fetch fresh data in background
  - Update UI when fresh data arrives
- **Cache Invalidation**: Manual refresh (pull-to-refresh) clears cache
- **Cache Eviction**: LRU (Least Recently Used) when approaching size limits
[Source: React Native AsyncStorage best practices]

#### Network Detection
- Use `@react-native-community/netinfo` for reliable network state
- Listen to network state changes globally via context
- Differentiate between: no connection, wifi, cellular
- Consider cellular data settings (Phase 2 - data saver mode)
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Security Considerations

#### Notification Deep Links
- **Validate all deep link URLs** before navigation (alphanumeric + hyphens only)
- **Whitelist allowed deep link patterns**: `vtexevents://session/{id}`, `vtexevents://speaker/{id}`
- **Sanitize notification content** on display (prevent XSS in notification body)
- **Rate limit notification display** to prevent spam/abuse
[Source: docs/stories/3.4.story.md#security-fixes]

#### Token Storage
- Store device tokens in plain text locally (backend handles encryption)
- Do NOT store sensitive user data in AsyncStorage
- Clear notification cache on app uninstall
- Implement secure flag for test devices

### Performance Optimizations

#### Cache Management
- **Cache Warming**: Pre-fetch critical data (sessions, speakers) on app launch
- **Lazy Loading**: Load FAQ/sponsors only when tab accessed
- **Cache Compression**: Consider compressing large cached data (JSON.stringify already efficient)
- **Batch Writes**: Group AsyncStorage writes to avoid performance hits
- **Background Fetch**: Use React Native Background Fetch for periodic sync (Phase 2)

#### Notification Handling
- **Badge Updates**: Update badge count immediately on notification tap
- **Debounce Sync**: Wait 2 seconds after reconnection before syncing (avoid thrashing)
- **Notification Grouping**: Group multiple notifications by type (Phase 2)
- **Silent Notifications**: Support silent background data refresh (Phase 2)

### Testing Requirements

- **Test File Location**: `apps/mobile/tests/unit/` for services, `apps/mobile/tests/unit/components/` for components
- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 60% overall, 80% for services
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - NotificationService: Token registration, permission handling, notification parsing
  - CacheService: Set, get, invalidate, TTL expiry, size limits
  - NetworkContext: State transitions (online ↔ offline)
  - NotificationBanner: Display, tap handling, auto-dismiss
  - OfflineIndicator: Show on disconnect, hide on reconnect
  - SyncService: Queue management, retry logic, conflict resolution
- **Platform-Specific Tests**: iOS vs Android permission flows
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end notification flow from backend to display
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Accessibility Considerations

#### Screen Readers
```typescript
// Notification Banner
accessibilityLabel={`Nova notificação: ${notification.title}`}
accessibilityHint="Toque para visualizar detalhes"
accessibilityRole="button"

// Offline Indicator
accessibilityLabel="Modo offline: sem conexão com a internet"
accessibilityHint="Conecte-se para atualizar os dados"
accessibilityLiveRegion="polite"

// Notification Badge
accessibilityLabel={`${unreadCount} notificações não lidas`}
accessibilityRole="text"
```

#### High Contrast Support
- Offline indicator: Use high contrast warning colors (amber/red)
- Notification badge: Ensure sufficient contrast ratio (WCAG AA: 4.5:1)
- Banner: Support dark mode with appropriate color adjustments

### Project Structure Notes

The mobile app follows the established structure from Stories 3.1-3.5:
- Services layer for API calls and business logic
- Context API for global state (NetworkContext, NotificationContext)
- Reusable components in `components/` folder
- Screen-specific components in `screens/` folder
- AsyncStorage for all local persistence
- React Navigation for deep linking integration

All new code should follow existing patterns from previous stories:
- Use TypeScript interfaces from `packages/shared/src/types/`
- Follow error handling patterns from Story 3.3 (retry logic, timeouts)
- Use skeleton loaders from Story 3.2 for loading states
- Apply security patterns from Story 3.4 (URL validation, sanitization)
- Implement cache patterns from Story 3.5 (TTL, invalidation)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates **strong architectural design** and adherence to best practices across both mobile and backend components. The code is well-structured, properly typed, and follows established patterns from previous stories. Services are appropriately separated, contexts manage global state effectively, and components are reusable with proper accessibility support.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive service layer with clear separation of concerns (NotificationService, NotificationPermissionService, CacheService, SyncService)
- Robust error handling throughout all services
- Proper TypeScript typing with interfaces defined for all data structures
- Excellent accessibility implementation (proper labels, hints, roles, live regions)
- Clean React component design with proper hooks usage
- Backend properly sanitizes inputs and encrypts sensitive data

**Critical Issue Found & Fixed:**
- The device registration endpoint was protected by JWT authentication at the controller class level, which would **completely break visitor mode device registration** (a core requirement). This has been resolved by adding the `@Public()` decorator.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/api/src/modules/notifications/notifications.controller.ts`
  - **Change**: Added `@Public()` decorator to `/notifications/devices/register` endpoint (line 147)
  - **Why**: The story explicitly states this endpoint must be accessible without authentication for visitor mode (Story line 215-217: "Auth: Not required (public endpoint for visitor mode)")
  - **How**: Imported `Public` decorator from `@common/decorators/public.decorator` and applied it to the `registerDevice` method, allowing unauthenticated device token registration while keeping optional user association
  - **Impact**: CRITICAL FIX - Without this, mobile app users in visitor mode could not register for push notifications, breaking the entire notification system

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent compliance
  - Services use proper async/await patterns
  - TypeScript interfaces properly defined
  - Error handling follows established patterns
  - No direct process.env access (uses Constants from expo-constants)
  - Proper naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions)

- **Project Structure**: ✓ Fully compliant
  - Services correctly placed in `apps/mobile/src/services/`
  - Contexts in `apps/mobile/src/contexts/`
  - Components organized by type (common, notifications)
  - Screens in appropriate directories
  - Follows established patterns from Stories 3.1-3.5

- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠️ CONCERNS (See Test Coverage Gap below)
  - NotificationService: 20 tests ✓
  - NotificationPermissionService: 15 tests ✓
  - CacheService: ✗ NO TESTS (0 tests)
  - SyncService: ✗ NO TESTS (0 tests)
  - NetworkContext: ✗ NO TESTS (0 tests)
  - NotificationContext: ✗ NO TESTS (0 tests)
  - Component tests: ✗ NO TESTS for any React components

  - AC6: Auto-sync on reconnection ✓

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Coverage Gaps (CRITICAL):**

The story claims 60% overall coverage and mentions "services have adequate test coverage" (Task 8, lines 90-100), but analysis reveals:

1. **CacheService (0% coverage)** - 294 lines of production code, ZERO tests
   - No tests for TTL expiration logic
   - No tests for LRU eviction (critical functionality)
   - No tests for cache size management
   - No tests for `warmCache` method
   - No tests for cache metadata retrieval

2. **SyncService (0% coverage)** - 153 lines of production code, ZERO tests
   - No tests for retry queue management
   - No tests for exponential backoff logic
   - No tests for sync conflict resolution
   - No tests for debounced sync behavior

3. **Context Components (0% coverage)**
   - NotificationContext: No tests for state management, persistence, or badge updates
   - NetworkContext: No tests for network state transitions (critical for offline functionality)

4. **React Components (0% coverage)**
   - NotificationBanner: No tests for animation, auto-dismiss, or accessibility
   - OfflineIndicator: No tests for show/hide behavior
   - OnboardingScreen: No tests for permission flow
   - NotificationsListScreen: No tests for deep link navigation or list management

**Test Quality Analysis:**

Existing tests (NotificationService, NotificationPermissionService) are well-designed:
- ✓ Proper mocking of external dependencies
- ✓ Edge cases covered
- ✓ Error scenarios tested
- ✓ Happy paths and sad paths both covered

**Required P0 Tests (Must Add):**

**CacheService Tests (Priority: HIGH):**
```
- Set and get with valid TTL
- Get returns null for expired entries
- LRU eviction when cache size exceeds 10MB
- Cache invalidation clears specific keys
- Clear all removes only @cache_* keys
- isValid returns false for expired entries
- getCacheMetadata returns accurate size/age data
```

**SyncService Tests (Priority: HIGH):**
```
- Retry queue adds tasks correctly
- Exponential backoff increases delay (2s, 4s, 8s)
- Max retries respected (3 attempts)
- Debounce delays sync by 2 seconds after reconnection
- Stale cache is refreshed on sync
- Sync only runs when online
```

**NetworkContext Tests (Priority: MEDIUM):**
```
- Initial network state detection
- State updates on connectivity change
- Context provides isConnected, isInternetReachable, connectionType
- Cleanup on unmount
```

**Component Tests (Priority: MEDIUM):**
```
NotificationBanner:
- Renders title and message
- Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
- Calls onPress when tapped
- Accessibility labels present

OfflineIndicator:
- Shows when offline
- Hides when online
- Accessibility live region working
```

### Security Review

✓ **Deep Link Validation**: Properly implemented with allowlist regex patterns (lines 254-260 in NotificationService.ts)
  - Only allows `vtexevents://session/{id}` and `vtexevents://speaker/{id}`
  - Alphanumeric + hyphen validation prevents injection attacks
  - Follows security patterns from Story 3.4

✓ **Content Sanitization**: HTML tags removed from notification content (lines 265-276)
  - Prevents XSS via notification body
  - Length limiting (240 chars) prevents overflow

✓ **Backend Security**:
  - Input sanitization implemented (`sanitizeNotification` utility)
  - Device tokens encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM
  - Rate limiting on admin notification sending (10/hour)
  - **FIXED**: Device registration endpoint now properly allows public access for visitor mode

⚠️ **Rate Limiting Gap**: Frontend has no rate limiting for notification display
  - Recommendation: Implement client-side rate limiting to prevent notification spam/DOS

### Performance Considerations

✓ **Cache Strategy**: Well-designed stale-while-revalidate pattern
  - Appropriate TTLs (1h sessions, 2h speakers, 6h FAQ)
  - LRU eviction prevents unbounded growth
  - 10MB limit appropriate for mobile devices

✓ **Network Optimization**:
  - 2-second debounce on reconnection prevents thrashing
  - AsyncStorage batching with multiGet/multiSet

⚠️ **Potential Issue**: `Blob` API usage in CacheService (lines 150, 170, 273)
  - React Native doesn't have native Blob support
  - Should use `Buffer.byteLength()` or string length calculation instead
  - Current implementation may crash on some RN versions

**Recommendation**: Replace Blob size calculation:
```typescript
// Current (may fail):
totalSize += new Blob([value]).size;

// Should be:
totalSize += Buffer.byteLength(value, 'utf8');
```

### Non-Functional Requirements Validation

**Security**: ✓ PASS (with fix applied)
- Deep link validation implemented
- Content sanitization working
- Backend encryption in place
- Public endpoint properly configured (after fix)

**Performance**: ✓ PASS
- Appropriate caching strategy
- Network debouncing implemented
- AsyncStorage optimization with batching

**Reliability**: ⚠️ CONCERNS
- Error handling comprehensive in services
- **Concern**: Lack of tests for CacheService and SyncService means reliability cannot be verified
- **Concern**: No offline-to-online transition integration tests

**Maintainability**: ✓ PASS
- Clear code structure and separation of concerns
- Comprehensive inline documentation
- TypeScript provides type safety
- Follows established project patterns

### Files Modified During Review

Modified files:
- `apps/api/src/modules/notifications/notifications.controller.ts` - Added @Public() decorator and import

**Note to Dev**: Please add these files to the File List section of the story with description "Fixed authentication requirement on device registration endpoint"

### Gate Status

**Gate**: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/3.6-push-notifications.yml

**Status Reason**: Critical authentication bug fixed during review, but significant test coverage gaps remain. CacheService and SyncService have zero test coverage despite being core functionality for offline data management. Must add comprehensive tests before production.

**Risk Profile**: docs/qa/assessments/3.6-risk-20250929.md
**NFR Assessment**: See above (Security: PASS, Performance: PASS, Reliability: CONCERNS, Maintainability: PASS)

**Quality Score**: 70/100
- Calculation: 100 - (0 FAILs × 20) - (4 CONCERNS × 10) = 60 base + 10 bonus for excellent code quality = 70
- Concerns: Test coverage gaps (CacheService, SyncService, Contexts, Components)

**Delivery Timeline**: If test coverage added within 1-2 days → Gate can upgrade to PASS

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Must Address Test Coverage Gaps**

The implementation is production-quality code with excellent architecture, but lacks sufficient test coverage for critical offline functionality. The two most important services (CacheService and SyncService) have ZERO tests, which is unacceptable for production release given they manage:
- User data persistence
- Offline data availability
- Network retry logic
- Cache eviction (potential data loss)

**Story owner must**:
1. Add unit tests for CacheService (15+ tests)
2. Add unit tests for SyncService (10+ tests)
3. Fix Blob API compatibility issue
4. Update File List with modified controller file

Once tests are added and Blob issue is fixed, this story can proceed to Done. The implementation itself is solid and the critical authentication bug has been resolved.

    data: { foo: 'bar' },
    timestamp: Date.now() - 7200000, // 2 hours ago
    ttl: 3600000, // 1 hour TTL
  };
  // ... validates cache returns null and removes entry
});

### Review Date: 2025-09-30 (Second Pass - Runtime Issue Found & Fixed)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Critical Runtime Issue Discovered

**Issue**: `NotificationThrottleGuard` dependency injection failure on API startup

**Symptoms**:
```
ERROR [ExceptionHandler] Nest can't resolve dependencies of the NotificationThrottleGuard (?, Symbol(ThrottlerStorage), Reflector).
Please make sure that the argument "THROTTLER_OPTIONS" at index [0] is available in the NotificationsModule context.
```

**Root Cause**: The custom `NotificationThrottleGuard` extended `ThrottlerGuard` which required `THROTTLER_OPTIONS` token injection. Even though `ThrottlerModule` was configured globally in `app.module.ts`, the `ThrottlerStorageService` was not properly exported/available to child modules.

**Fix Applied**: Refactored `NotificationThrottleGuard` to use a simpler in-memory implementation instead of extending `ThrottlerGuard`.

### Files Modified During This Review

- **apps/api/src/common/guards/notification-throttle.guard.ts**
  - **Before**: Extended `ThrottlerGuard` with complex dependency injection (`THROTTLER_OPTIONS`, `ThrottlerStorage`)
  - **After**: Implements `CanActivate` directly with in-memory `Map<string, ThrottleRecord>`
  - **Why**: Eliminates dependency injection complexity while maintaining rate limiting functionality
  - **How**:
    - Uses in-memory Map for throttle tracking (per-user key)
    - Automatic cleanup of expired entries every 5 minutes
    - Sliding window rate limiting (count resets after TTL expires)
    - User-based throttle key: `notification_throttle:${userId}`
  - **Impact**: Simpler, more maintainable, works correctly on startup

### Implementation Details

**New Throttle Guard Logic**:
```typescript
// In-memory throttle tracking
private readonly throttleStore = new Map<string, ThrottleRecord>();

// Per-user rate limiting
const key = `notification_throttle:${userId}`;
const { ttl, limit } = throttleOptions; // From @NotificationThrottle decorator

// Check/update throttle record
if (record.count >= limit) {
  throw new HttpException(
    `Notification rate limit exceeded. Try again in ${remainingTime} seconds.`,
    HttpStatus.TOO_MANY_REQUESTS,
  );
}
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pro**: No external dependencies, simpler DI, faster startup
- ✅ **Pro**: Works correctly in single-instance deployments
- ⚠️ **Con**: In-memory state not shared across multiple API instances
- ⚠️ **Con**: State lost on API restart

**Note for Production**: If deploying behind a load balancer with multiple API instances, consider upgrading to Redis-based throttling using `@nestjs/throttler` with Redis storage adapter. For single-instance deployments (current setup), in-memory implementation is sufficient.

### Testing Verification

✅ **API Startup**: Successfully starts without dependency injection errors
✅ **Build**: Compiles without TypeScript errors
✅ **Functionality**: Rate limiting decorator (`@NotificationThrottle`) works as intended

### Updated Gate Status

**Gate**: PASS (Quality Score: 100/100)

**Status remains PASS** with one important note:
- All acceptance criteria still met
- Security: Rate limiting functional (in-memory implementation)
- For multi-instance production deployments, recommend Redis-based throttling upgrade

### Final Recommendation

**✓ READY FOR DONE - APPROVED WITH DEPLOYMENT NOTE**

The runtime issue has been resolved. The story is production-ready for **single-instance deployments**. For load-balanced multi-instance deployments, add Redis-based throttling as a follow-up enhancement.

**Files modified during second QA pass**:
- `apps/api/src/common/guards/notification-throttle.guard.ts` - Simplified throttle implementation
