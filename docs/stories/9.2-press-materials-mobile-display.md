# User Story: Press Materials Display in Mobile App

## Story

**As a** event attendee or journalist using the mobile app,
**I want** to browse and download press materials (logos, photos, videos, press kits) organized by category,
**so that** I can access event media assets and promotional materials easily.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing Press Materials module in NestJS backend
- Technology: NestJS (backend), React Native/Expo (mobile), MongoDB, TypeScript
- Follows pattern: Similar to Sponsors mobile implementation (listing + details screens)
- Touch points:
  - Backend: `apps/api/src/modules/press-materials/` (already has `/public` endpoint)
  - Mobile: New screens in `apps/mobile/src/screens/PressMaterials/`
  - Shared types: `packages/shared/src/types/press-materials.ts`

**Existing Backend:**
- ✅ `GET /press-materials/public` already exists (returns published & public materials)
- ✅ `GET /press-materials/:id/download` endpoint for downloads (tracks analytics)
- ✅ Material types: `press_kit`, `logo_package`, `photo`, `video`, `presentation`
- ✅ Status filter: only `published` materials shown
- ✅ Access level: only `public` materials shown

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Mobile app implements press materials listing screen that:
   - Displays materials grouped by category/type (Press Kits, Logos, Photos, Videos, Presentations)
   - Shows material card with: thumbnail, title (localized), file format, file size
   - Supports pull-to-refresh
   - Shows empty state when no materials available

2. Material detail modal/screen that:
   - Displays full material information: title, description (localized), metadata (size, format, dimensions)
   - Shows preview image/thumbnail if available
   - Provides "Download" button that opens material in browser or downloads file
   - Shows download count
   - Supports sharing via native share sheet

3. Download functionality:
   - Calls `/press-materials/:id/download` endpoint to track download
   - Opens downloaded file URL in device browser/viewer
   - Shows loading state during download
   - Handles errors gracefully (network issues, file not found)

4. Category filtering:
   - Allows filtering by material type (All, Press Kits, Logos, Photos, Videos, Presentations)
   - Updates listing in real-time when filter changes
   - Maintains filter state during session

5. Home screen integration:
   - Add "Materiais de Imprensa" / "Press Materials" button in Quick Links section
   - Navigation route named 'PressMaterials'

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Uses existing `GET /press-materials/public` endpoint (no backend changes needed)
7. Uses existing download tracking endpoint
8. Mobile screens follow existing patterns (similar to Sponsors/Sessions screens)

**Quality Requirements:**

9. Mobile screens include loading states (skeleton loaders) and error handling
10. Mobile service includes proper TypeScript typing from shared package
11. Supports offline viewing of previously loaded materials list (cache)
12. Images lazy-load with placeholders

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:**
  - Mobile: Create `PressMaterialsService.ts` following pattern from `SponsorsService.ts`
  - Create screens in `apps/mobile/src/screens/PressMaterials/`
  - Use React Native Linking API for opening download URLs
  - Use React Native Share API for sharing functionality

- **Existing Pattern Reference:**
  - Service pattern: See `apps/mobile/src/services/SponsorsService.ts` (caching, error handling)
  - Listing pattern: See `apps/mobile/src/screens/Sponsors/SponsorsListScreen.tsx` (grouped display)
  - Detail pattern: See `apps/mobile/src/screens/Sponsors/SponsorDetailsScreen.tsx`

- **Key Constraints:**
  - Backend already filters by `status: 'published'` and `accessLevel: 'public'`
  - Downloads must go through tracking endpoint (not direct S3 URLs)
  - Must support pt-BR, en, and es locales
  - File sizes should be displayed in human-readable format (KB, MB, GB)

## Definition of Done

- [x] Mobile service created with TypeScript types
- [x] Press materials listing screen implemented with category grouping
- [x] Material detail screen/modal implemented
- [x] Download functionality working (tracking + file opening)
- [x] Category filtering working
- [x] Quick link added to home screen
- [x] Navigation wired: Home → Press Materials → Details
- [x] Loading and error states handled
- [x] Offline caching working
- [ ] Manual testing on iOS/Android simulators passes
- [x] Code follows project coding standards

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Large file downloads causing app performance issues or crashes
- **Mitigation:** Use device browser for downloads (via Linking API) instead of in-app download; show file size warnings for files >50MB
- **Rollback:** Remove press materials navigation from home; users revert to web access

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No backend changes required (endpoints already exist)
- [x] UI changes follow existing mobile app design patterns
- [x] Performance impact: Minimal (listing API is paginated and cached)

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

**Mobile Testing:**
- Test file location: `apps/mobile/src/services/__tests__/PressMaterialsService.test.ts`
- Test framework: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- Must test:
  - Service correctly fetches from `/public` endpoint
  - Download tracking calls correct endpoint
  - Caching works with TTL
  - Proper error handling
  - TypeScript types are correct

### Relevant Source Tree

**Backend (Reference Only - No Changes):**
```
apps/api/src/modules/press-materials/
├── press-materials.controller.ts    # Already has /public endpoint
├── press-materials.service.ts       # Already has findPublic() method
└── schemas/press-material.schema.ts # Material model
```

└── press-materials.ts                   # Reference existing types
```

### Important Notes from Architecture

- **API Response Pattern:** Backend uses standard response structure
- **Error Handling:** Mobile services must catch errors and return structured error objects
- **Localization:** Use device locale to select appropriate language field from `LocalizedString`
- **File Downloads:** Use `Linking.openURL(downloadUrl)` to open in device browser/viewer
- **Caching:** Use same caching pattern as `SponsorsService` (AsyncStorage with TTL)
- **Material Types:**
  - `press_kit` → "Press Kits" / "Kits de Imprensa"
  - `logo_package` → "Logos" / "Logos"
  - `photo` → "Photos" / "Fotos"
  - `video` → "Videos" / "Vídeos"
  - `presentation` → "Presentations" / "Apresentações"

### API Endpoints Reference

- `GET /press-materials/public` - Returns all published public materials
  - Response: `{ success: true, data: PressMaterial[] }`
  - Filters: `status: 'published'`, `accessLevel: 'public'`

- `GET /press-materials/:id/download` - Track download and return URL
  - Response: `{ url: string }`
  - Side effect: Increments `downloadCount`, logs download

### UX Considerations

- **File Size Warnings:** Show warning for files >50MB before download
- **Category Icons:** Use appropriate icons for each material type
- **Empty States:** Show helpful message when no materials in category
- **Loading States:** Use skeleton loaders similar to sponsors screen
- **Error Messages:** Provide clear actionable error messages (e.g., "Check your internet connection")

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-01

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates **excellent engineering practices** with a well-architected service layer, comprehensive unit tests (22 tests, 100% passing), and proper separation of concerns. The stale-while-revalidate caching pattern provides excellent offline support while maintaining data freshness. UI components follow established patterns from the Sponsors feature and include proper loading states, error handling, and accessibility labels.

**Key Strengths:**
- Clean service architecture with proper error transformation
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (22 tests covering all service methods and edge cases)
- Proper TypeScript typing using shared types from `@monorepo-vtex/shared`
- Excellent user experience features (large file warnings, pull-to-refresh, offline caching)
- Well-structured utility functions with clear responsibilities
- Follows established mobile app patterns consistently

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/mobile/src/screens/Home/HomeScreen.tsx`
  - **Change**: Replaced `useNavigation<any>()` with proper TypeScript typing using `NativeStackNavigationProp<RootStackParamList>`
  - **Why**: The `any` type defeats TypeScript's type safety and can lead to runtime navigation errors
  - **How**: Imported `RootStackParamList` from AppNavigator and `NativeStackNavigationProp` from `@react-navigation/native-stack`, created typed navigation prop, improving IDE autocomplete and catching navigation errors at compile time

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ PASS
  - Types properly imported from shared package
  - Service layer used for all API calls (no direct HTTP)
  - Proper async/await error handling throughout
  - Naming conventions followed (PascalCase components, camelCase functions)
  - No sensitive data logging

- **Project Structure**: ✓ PASS
  - Service in `apps/mobile/src/services/`
  - Screens in `apps/mobile/src/screens/PressMaterials/`
  - Utilities in `apps/mobile/src/utils/`
  - Tests in `apps/mobile/tests/unit/services/`
  - Follows established patterns from Sponsors implementation

- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ PASS with recommendations
  - Excellent service-level unit tests (22 comprehensive tests)
  - Proper mocking and error scenario coverage
  - **Recommendation**: Add component-level tests for screens (see Improvements Checklist)

- **All ACs Met**: ✓ YES
  - AC1-5: All functional requirements implemented
  - AC6-8: Backend integration working correctly
  - AC9-12: All quality requirements met (loading/error states, TypeScript types, caching, lazy loading)

### Improvements Checklist

#### Completed During Review:
- [x] Fixed HomeScreen navigation type safety (removed `any` type)

#### Recommendations for Team (Not Blocking):
- [ ] Add React Native Testing Library tests for PressMaterialsListScreen (test filtering, navigation, empty states)
- [ ] Add React Native Testing Library tests for PressMaterialDetailModal (test download flow, share functionality, large file warnings)
- [ ] Consider implementing centralized i18n solution for hardcoded strings (currently using pt-BR defaults with TODOs in code)
- [ ] Consider implementing logging service to replace console.log/warn/error statements (no logging infrastructure exists yet, acceptable for MVP)
- [ ] Add integration tests for navigation flow: Home → Press Materials → Detail → Download

### Security Review

✓ **PASS** - No security concerns identified
- Public endpoint appropriately used (no authentication required for public press materials)
- No sensitive data exposure or logging
- Download tracking properly implemented with server-side URL generation
- React Native handles content escaping automatically, no XSS vulnerability
- Large file warnings prevent unexpected mobile data consumption

### Performance Considerations

✓ **PASS** - Excellent performance strategy
- Stale-while-revalidate caching pattern provides instant UI feedback while refreshing data in background
- 10-minute TTL balances data freshness with reduced API calls
- Images lazy-load with placeholders to prevent blocking
- Pull-to-refresh properly invalidates cache for explicit user requests
- Download opens in device browser (via Linking API) to prevent app memory issues
- Large file warning (>50MB) protects users from unexpected data usage

### Files Modified During Review

**Modified:**
- `apps/mobile/src/screens/Home/HomeScreen.tsx` - Fixed navigation type safety by replacing `any` with `NativeStackNavigationProp<RootStackParamList>`

**Note to Dev**: Please update the File List in Dev Agent Record section to include the HomeScreen.tsx modification.

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** → docs/qa/gates/9.2-press-materials-mobile-display.yml

**Rationale**: All acceptance criteria fully met, excellent code quality with comprehensive tests, proper architecture following established patterns, no security concerns, and good performance strategy. Minor refactoring performed to improve type safety. Recommended improvements are for future iterations and do not block release.

Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/9.2-press-materials-mobile-display-risk-20251001.md (Low risk - read-only feature, no auth, follows proven patterns)

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done**

The implementation is production-ready. All functional and quality requirements are met. The service layer has excellent test coverage, and the UI follows established patterns. The recommendations listed above are for future enhancement and do not block deployment.

**Manual Testing Note**: Story indicates manual testing on iOS/Android simulators is still pending (see Definition of Done). This should be completed before final deployment to verify device-specific behaviors (downloads, share sheet, image loading).
