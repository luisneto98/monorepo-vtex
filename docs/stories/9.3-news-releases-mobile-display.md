# User Story: News & Releases Display in Mobile App

## Story

**As a** event attendee or journalist using the mobile app,
**I want** to view published news releases and event updates with rich content,
**so that** I can stay informed about event announcements, news, and important updates.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing News Releases module in NestJS backend
- Technology: NestJS (backend), React Native/Expo (mobile), MongoDB, TypeScript
- Follows pattern: Similar to Press Materials and Sponsors mobile implementation
- Touch points:
  - Backend: `apps/api/src/modules/news-releases/` (already has public endpoint `/public/news`)
  - Mobile: New screens in `apps/mobile/src/screens/NewsReleases/`
  - Shared types: `packages/shared/src/types/news-releases.ts`

**Existing Backend:**
- ✅ `GET /public/news` already exists (returns published news with filters)
- ✅ `GET /public/news/featured` for featured articles
- ✅ `GET /public/news/:slug` for article details
- ✅ Rich content support: multilingual (pt-BR, en, es), images gallery, categories, tags
- ✅ Status filter: only `published` articles shown
- ✅ View count tracking built-in

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Mobile app implements news feed listing screen that:
   - Displays published news releases in reverse chronological order (newest first)
   - Shows article card with: featured image, title (localized), excerpt/subtitle, publish date, categories
   - Featured articles displayed prominently at the top
   - Supports infinite scroll/pagination for browsing older articles
   - Supports pull-to-refresh

2. Article detail screen that:
   - Displays full article with: title, subtitle, rich HTML content, featured image, image gallery
   - Shows metadata: publish date, categories, tags, author name
   - Renders HTML content properly (rich text with images, formatting, links)
   - Supports image gallery viewer (swipeable, full-screen view)
   - Shows related articles section at the bottom
   - Increments view count automatically on article view

3. Category/Tag filtering:
   - Shows available categories as filter chips
   - Allows filtering by single category
   - Updates feed in real-time when filter applied
   - Shows "All" option to clear filters

4. Search functionality:
   - Search bar at the top of feed
   - Real-time search as user types (debounced)
   - Searches across titles and content (in selected language)
   - Shows empty state when no results

5. Home screen integration:
   - Add "Notícias" / "News" button in Quick Links section
   - Navigation route named 'NewsReleases'
   - Badge indicator for new articles (optional - count unread in last 7 days)

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Uses existing `GET /public/news` endpoint with pagination (no backend changes needed)
7. Uses existing `/public/news/:slug` endpoint for article details
8. Mobile screens follow existing patterns (similar to Press Materials screens)

**Quality Requirements:**

9. Mobile screens include loading states (skeleton loaders) and error handling
10. HTML content rendered securely (sanitized, no script execution)
11. Images lazy-load with placeholders
12. Offline caching for previously viewed articles
13. Share functionality for articles (native share sheet)

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:**
  - Mobile: Create `NewsReleasesService.ts` following pattern from `PressMaterialsService.ts`
  - Create screens in `apps/mobile/src/screens/NewsReleases/`
  - Use `react-native-render-html` for displaying rich HTML content
  - Use React Native Image for image gallery with zoom/pinch support
  - Use React Native Share API for sharing articles

- **Existing Pattern Reference:**
  - Service pattern: See `apps/mobile/src/services/PressMaterialsService.ts`
  - Listing pattern: See `apps/mobile/src/screens/PressMaterials/PressMaterialsListScreen.tsx`
  - Detail pattern: See `apps/mobile/src/screens/Sponsors/SponsorDetailsScreen.tsx`

- **Key Constraints:**
  - Backend already filters by `status: 'published'`
  - HTML content must be sanitized before rendering (XSS protection)
  - Must support pt-BR, en, and es locales
  - Dates should be displayed in relative format ("2 days ago") and localized
  - Image gallery should support swipe gestures

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

**Mobile Testing:**
- Test file location: `apps/mobile/src/services/__tests__/NewsReleasesService.test.ts`
- Test framework: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- Must test:
  - Service correctly fetches from `/public/news` endpoint
  - Pagination works correctly
  - Filtering and search params passed correctly
  - View count tracking calls correct endpoint
  - Caching works with TTL
  - Proper error handling
  - TypeScript types are correct

### Relevant Source Tree

**Backend (Reference Only - No Changes):**

### Important Notes from Architecture

- **API Response Pattern:** Backend uses standard response structure
- **Error Handling:** Mobile services must catch errors and return structured error objects
- **Localization:** Use device locale to select appropriate content language (`content['pt-BR']`, `content.en`, `content.es`)
- **HTML Rendering:** Use `react-native-render-html` v6+ with proper configuration for images and links
- **View Tracking:** Call view count endpoint once per article view (use ref to prevent multiple calls)
- **Caching Strategy:**
  - Feed: 5-minute TTL (news updates frequently)
  - Viewed articles: Permanent cache (allow offline reading)
- **Infinite Scroll:** Use `onEndReached` with `onEndReachedThreshold={0.5}` on FlatList
- **Search Debouncing:** Use `setTimeout` or `lodash.debounce` with 500ms delay

### API Endpoints Reference

- `GET /public/news` - Returns published news releases
  - Query params: `page`, `limit`, `language`, `category`, `tag`, `search`
  - Response: `{ data: NewsRelease[], pagination: {...} }`
  - Filters: `status: 'published'`, `isDeleted: false`

- `GET /public/news/featured` - Returns featured articles
  - Response: `{ data: NewsRelease[] }`
  - Max 5 featured articles

- `GET /public/news/:slug` - Returns single article by slug
  - Response: `{ data: NewsRelease }`
  - Automatically increments `viewCount`

### UX Considerations

- **Featured Articles:** Display in a horizontal carousel at the top of feed
- **Article Cards:** Use card design with featured image as hero, 2-line title, 1-line excerpt
- **Category Chips:** Use horizontal ScrollView with filter chips (Material Design style)
- **Search:** Show search icon, expand to search bar on tap, show clear button when text entered
- **Empty States:**
  - No articles: "Nenhuma notícia publicada ainda"
  - No search results: "Nenhum resultado encontrado para '{query}'"
  - Network error: "Erro ao carregar notícias" with Retry button
- **Loading States:** Use skeleton loaders for cards (3-4 cards visible)
- **HTML Content:** Use responsive width, proper typography, handle embedded images
- **Image Gallery:** Full-screen modal with swipe navigation, caption display, close button
- **Dates:** Show relative dates for recent articles ("2 hours ago"), full dates for older ("Jan 15, 2025")

### Dependencies to Install

### Refactoring Performed

**Major Refactoring Applied (QA-Driven Stability Fix):**

1. **File**: `apps/mobile/package.json`
   - **Change**: Replaced `react-native-render-html` ecosystem with `react-native-webview`
   - **Why**: react-native-render-html had cascading dependency issues (entities, ramda ESM conflicts) that are unstable
   - **How**: Removed react-native-render-html, entities, ramda; installed react-native-webview (industry standard, zero conflicts)

2. **File**: `apps/mobile/src/screens/NewsReleases/NewsReleaseDetailScreen.tsx`
   - **Change 1**: Replaced react-native-render-html with WebView-based HTML rendering
   - **Why**: WebView is more stable, has better HTML/CSS support, and no dependency conflicts
   - **How**: Created inline HTML document with proper styling, viewport meta tags, and sanitized content injection
   - **Change 2**: Replaced `react-native-image-viewing` with custom Modal-based image gallery
   - **Why**: react-native-image-viewing has broken imports and web compatibility issues
   - **How**: Implemented custom fullscreen image gallery using React Native Modal with navigation arrows, close button, image counter

### Security Review

**✓ XSS Protection - Excellent**
- HTML content sanitized on client-side with comprehensive regex patterns
- Removes `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>` tags
- Strips event handlers (onclick, onerror, etc.)
- Removes javascript: protocol from links
- Backend should also sanitize (defense in depth)

**✓ Data Exposure - Secure**
- No sensitive data logged in service layer
- Error messages user-friendly without exposing internals
- View count tracking fails silently if unauthorized

**✓ Input Validation - Good**
- Search query properly encoded via axios params
- Filter inputs validated through TypeScript types
- No direct string interpolation in API calls

**Recommendation**: Verify backend HTML sanitization is active for complete defense-in-depth.

### Performance Considerations

**✓ Caching Strategy - Excellent**
- Feed: 5-minute TTL with stale-while-revalidate (optimal UX)
- Articles: Permanent cache for offline reading
- Background refresh prevents blocking user interactions

**✓ List Performance - Good**
- FlatList with proper keyExtractor
- Infinite scroll with onEndReached threshold 0.5
- Pull-to-refresh implemented
- Consider: VirtualizedList if feed exceeds 1000 items (unlikely)

**✓ Image Optimization - Good**
- Thumbnail URLs used in gallery where available
- Image resizeMode="cover" prevents layout shifts
- React Native Image handles lazy loading natively

**✓ Network Efficiency - Excellent**
- Debounced search (500ms) reduces API calls
- Paginated requests (limit: 10) prevent over-fetching
- Cache-first strategy minimizes network usage

### NFR Validation

**Security: PASS**
- XSS protection implemented
- No sensitive data exposure
- Proper error handling without leaking internals

**Performance: PASS**
- Sub-second load times expected with caching
- Infinite scroll prevents memory issues
- Efficient network usage with pagination

**Reliability: PASS**
- Comprehensive error handling with fallbacks
- Stale cache returned on network errors
- View tracking fails silently (non-critical)
- All tests passing (15/15)

**Maintainability: PASS**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-documented code with JSDoc comments
- Consistent patterns with existing codebase
- Comprehensive test coverage
- TypeScript provides type safety

### Test Coverage Analysis

**Service Layer: Comprehensive**
- ✓ API calls with proper params
- ✓ Cache hit/miss scenarios
- ✓ Error handling (404, 500, network)
- ✓ Stale-while-revalidate pattern
- ✓ Localization logic
- ✓ Filter transformation
- ✓ Permanent vs TTL caching

**Screen Layer: Visual Testing Required**
- Component renders (requires manual testing)
- User interactions (tap, scroll, search)
