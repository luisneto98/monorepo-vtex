## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 2.2 Dev Agent Record]
- Authentication token is stored as 'access_token' in localStorage
- Use type-only imports for TypeScript interfaces to avoid circular dependencies
- Image upload components can be reused/adapted for sponsor logos
- Implemented multilingual support pattern with tabs (PT/EN) can be extended
- Pagination pattern established with metadata response format
- Form validation with zod and react-hook-form patterns established

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Session]
```typescript
interface ISession {
  _id: Types.ObjectId;
  title: {
    'pt-BR': string;
    'en': string;
  };
  description: {
    'pt-BR': string;
    'en': string;
  };
  speakerIds: Types.ObjectId[];  // Many-to-many with speakers
  startTime: Date;
  endTime: Date;
  stage: string;
  tags: string[];
  sponsorIds?: Types.ObjectId[];  // Many-to-many with sponsors
  isHighlight: boolean;
  isVisible: boolean;
  capacity?: number;
  streamUrl?: string; // For phase 2 live streaming
  materials?: {
    title: string;
    url: string;
    type: 'pdf' | 'video' | 'link';
  }[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#Sessions]
Admin endpoints (require authentication):
- GET /sessions - List with pagination, filters, search
  - Query params: page, limit, sort, search, stage, date, tags, speakerId
  - Returns paginated response with metadata
- GET /sessions/:id - Get single session with populated relations
- POST /sessions - Create new session
  - Validates schedule conflicts server-side
- PUT /sessions/:id - Update session
  - Re-validates conflicts if time/stage changed
- DELETE /sessions/:id - Soft delete session

Response format follows established pattern:
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  data: ISession[] | ISession;
  metadata?: {
    total: number;
    page: number;
    limit: number;
    hasNext: boolean;
    hasPrev: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - shadcn/ui components]
- Table - For sessions listing with advanced features
- Dialog/Sheet - For add/edit form (consider Sheet for more space)
- Form - With react-hook-form integration
- Input, Textarea - Multilingual form fields
- Select/MultiSelect - For speakers and sponsors selection
- DatePicker, TimePicker - For schedule management
- Tags - For tag input and display
- Tabs - For multilingual content and preview modes
- Switch - For boolean toggles (highlight, visibility)
- Badge - Status and conflict indicators

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

Test files location:
```
apps/admin/tests/
├── unit/
│   └── components/
│       └── sessions/
│           ├── SessionsList.test.tsx
│           ├── SessionForm.test.tsx
│           ├── SessionPreview.test.tsx
│           └── ConflictIndicator.test.tsx
└── integration/
    └── services/
        ├── sessions.service.test.ts
        └── conflict-detection.test.ts
```

Testing patterns:
- Use MSW for mocking API responses
- Test form with invalid/valid multilingual data
- Test conflict detection with overlapping sessions
- Test speaker/sponsor relationship management
- Verify preview renders correctly in both languages
- Test pagination, filtering, and sorting
- Ensure accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Test timezone handling for international events

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]
- Response time must be <200ms for list queries
- Implement debounce on search (500ms)
- Lazy load sponsor logos in selection
- Cache speaker/sponsor lists for multi-select
- Validate file size for any uploaded materials (<10MB)
- Sanitize HTML in description fields if using rich text
- Implement optimistic UI updates where appropriate

### Additional Notes
- Epic mentions ES (Spanish) support, but current types only have pt-BR and en. Implement with two languages, structure allows easy addition of 'es' field later
- "Nível técnico" (technical level) is not in the current Session type - add as custom field or tag category
- Consider using a rich text editor for descriptions if needed (not specified in requirements)
- Schedule conflict validation must consider speaker availability across parallel sessions
- Preview should show responsive design (mobile and desktop views)

## Testing

### Test File Locations
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests: `apps/admin/tests/unit/components/sessions/`
- Integration tests: `apps/admin/tests/integration/services/`
- Follow 60/30/10 split for unit/integration/e2e tests

### Testing Standards
- Use Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Mock external dependencies with MSW or vi.mock
- Test components with React Testing Library
- Include tests for loading, error, and success states
- Test form validation with multiple invalid scenarios
- Verify API error handling and retry logic
- Test accessibility with keyboard navigation
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new components

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The Sessions management feature has been well-implemented with comprehensive functionality covering all acceptance criteria. The implementation follows React best practices, uses proper TypeScript typing, and maintains good separation of concerns. The component architecture is modular and maintainable.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: packages/shared/src/types/session.types.ts
  - **Change**: Renamed `Session` interface to `ISession` with backward compatibility alias
  - **Why**: Consistency with component usage and project conventions
  - **How**: Maintains type safety while fixing import misalignment

- **File**: apps/admin/src/components/sessions/SessionsList.tsx
  - **Change**: Added confirmation dialog for deletion operations
  - **Why**: Prevent accidental data loss
  - **How**: Added user confirmation before destructive actions

- **File**: apps/admin/src/components/sessions/SessionsList.tsx
  - **Change**: Fixed error state handling and added retry capability
  - **Why**: Improved user experience during failures
  - **How**: Added error state display with retry button

- **File**: apps/admin/src/components/sessions/ConflictIndicator.tsx
  - **Change**: Enhanced conflict warnings with clearer messaging
  - **Why**: Better user guidance for schedule conflicts
  - **How**: Added explicit warnings about impact on attendees and speakers

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Components follow React/TypeScript best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Files organized according to unified structure

### Security Review

- Authentication properly implemented with Bearer token in all API calls
- No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
- Proper input validation through zod schemas
- Added confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- No XSS vulnerabilities detected in rendered content

### Performance Considerations

- Debounced search implementation (500ms) reduces API calls
