## Dev Notes

### Problem Context
Currently, the frontend attempts to call `POST /api/upload/speaker-photo`, which does not exist in the backend. The SpeakersController has CRUD endpoints but no photo upload functionality. Additionally, S3 upload logic is duplicated across multiple modules (legal-pages and press-materials), creating maintenance overhead.

**Files with upload functionality:**
- `apps/api/src/modules/legal-pages/services/s3-storage.service.ts` - S3 operations
- `apps/api/src/modules/legal-pages/services/virus-scanner.service.ts` - File scanning
- `apps/api/src/modules/press-materials/press-materials.controller.ts:213-248` - Upload endpoint
- `apps/admin/src/services/speakers.service.ts:82-94` - Frontend upload attempt

**Solution:**
Create a centralized Storage module that consolidates S3 operations and virus scanning, then implement speaker photo upload using this shared module.

**Frontend Structure:**
```

└── services/
    └── speakers.service.ts               # UPDATE uploadPhoto endpoint
```

### Storage Module Architecture

The new Storage module will provide a unified interface for all file operations:

```typescript
// storage.service.ts key methods
interface StorageService {
  uploadFile(file: Express.Multer.File, category: FileCategory, options?: UploadOptions): Promise<UploadResult>;
  deleteFile(key: string): Promise<void>;
  getSignedUrl(key: string, expiresIn?: number): Promise<string>;
  validateFile(file: Express.Multer.File, options: FileValidationOptions): Promise<boolean>;
}

interface UploadOptions {
  maxSizeBytes?: number;        // Default: 5MB for images, 10MB for documents
  allowedMimeTypes?: string[];  // Default: based on category
  scanForVirus?: boolean;       // Default: true
  metadata?: Record<string, string>;
}

enum FileCategory {
  SPEAKER_PHOTOS = 'speaker-photos',
  LEGAL_DOCUMENTS = 'legal-documents',
  PRESS_MATERIALS = 'press-materials',
}
```

### Image Validation Requirements

**Allowed MIME Types:**
- image/jpeg
- image/png
- image/webp

**Validation Steps:**
1. Check file exists and is not empty
2. Validate MIME type from multer
3. Validate magic bytes (first bytes of file) match declared type
4. Check file size <= 5MB (5 * 1024 * 1024 bytes)
5. Scan for viruses using VirusScannerService
6. Generate unique S3 key: `speaker-photos/{timestamp}-{random}.{ext}`

**Magic Bytes Reference:**
- JPEG: `FF D8 FF`
- PNG: `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A`
- WebP: `52 49 46 46 [4 bytes] 57 45 42 50`

### API Endpoint Specification

**New Endpoint:**
```
POST /speakers/:id/upload-photo
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}
Roles: SUPER_ADMIN, PRODUCER

Body:
  file: <binary> (form field name: 'file')

Response 200:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "photoUrl": "https://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/speaker-photos/1234567890-abc123.jpg"
  }
}

Response 400 - Invalid file type:
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid file type. Only JPEG, PNG, and WebP images are allowed."
}

Response 400 - File too large:
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "File size exceeds maximum allowed size of 5MB."
}

Response 400 - Virus detected:
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "File failed security scan and was rejected."
}

Response 404 - Speaker not found:
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Speaker not found."
}

Response 429 - Rate limit exceeded:
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Upload rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
}
```

### Virus Scanner Integration

The existing `VirusScannerService` from legal-pages will be moved to the Storage module:

**Key Features:**
- Optional ClamAV integration if configured
- Fallback to heuristic scanning if ClamAV unavailable
- PDF-specific checks will be generalized for all file types
- Image-specific checks: No embedded scripts, excessive metadata
- Magic byte validation for declared file type
- Configuration via environment variables:
  - `VIRUS_SCANNING_ENABLED` (default: false)
  - `CLAMAV_HOST` (optional)
  - `CLAMAV_PORT` (default: 3310)

### Throttling Configuration

Following the pattern from Story 2.7 (push notifications), implement upload rate limiting:

**Configuration:**
- 5 uploads per minute per authenticated user
- Use `@Throttle` decorator from `@nestjs/throttler`
- Redis-backed throttling for distributed environments
- Apply to: `POST /speakers/:id/upload-photo`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
@Post(':id/upload-photo')
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
@Roles(UserRole.SUPER_ADMIN, UserRole.PRODUCER)
@UseInterceptors(FileInterceptor('file'))
@Throttle({ default: { limit: 5, ttl: 60000 } }) // 5 uploads per minute
@ApiBearerAuth('JWT-auth')
// ... endpoint implementation
```

### Migration Strategy for Existing Modules

**Step-by-step migration approach:**
1. Create Storage module with all services
2. Add comprehensive tests for Storage module
3. Import StorageModule in SpeakersModule and implement speaker upload
4. Test speaker upload thoroughly
5. Update LegalPagesModule to import StorageModule
6. Replace S3StorageService calls with StorageService in legal-pages
7. Run legal-pages tests - fix any issues
8. Update PressMaterialsModule to import StorageModule
9. Replace S3 calls with StorageService in press-materials
10. Run press-materials tests - fix any issues
11. Remove deprecated S3StorageService from legal-pages
12. Update all test mocks to use StorageService

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Keep S3StorageService temporarily until migration complete
- Mark S3StorageService as `@deprecated` with migration notes
- All existing endpoints continue working during migration
- Remove S3StorageService only after all tests pass

### Error Handling Patterns

Follow existing patterns from legal-pages and notifications modules:

```typescript
// File validation error
throw new BadRequestException('Invalid file type. Only JPEG, PNG, and WebP images are allowed.');

// File size error
throw new BadRequestException('File size exceeds maximum allowed size of 5MB.');

// Virus scan failure
throw new BadRequestException('File failed security scan and was rejected.');

// Speaker not found
throw new NotFoundException('Speaker not found');

// S3 upload failure
throw new InternalServerErrorException('Failed to upload file to storage');

// Rate limit exceeded (handled by ThrottlerGuard)
throw new ThrottlerException('Upload rate limit exceeded. Please try again later.');
```

### Environment Variables

**Existing (from legal-pages):**
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region for S3 (default: us-east-1)
- `AWS_S3_BUCKET` - S3 bucket name
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS credentials
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS credentials
- `VIRUS_SCANNING_ENABLED` - Enable virus scanning (default: false)
- `CLAMAV_HOST` - ClamAV server host (optional)
- `CLAMAV_PORT` - ClamAV server port (default: 3310)

**No new environment variables needed** - reuse existing configuration.

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.7 (Push Notifications):
- Rate limiting pattern: Use `@Throttle` decorator with Redis-backed throttler
- Input sanitization: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Security-first approach: Authentication, authorization, rate limiting, validation
- Comprehensive error handling with clear user messages
- Test-driven development with unit and integration tests
[Source: 2.7.story.md]

From Story 8 (Legal Pages):
- S3 upload pattern established with virus scanning
- File validation with magic bytes and heuristic checks
- ConfigService pattern for AWS credentials
- Error handling for S3 operations
[Source: apps/api/src/modules/legal-pages/services/]

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests (Target: 80% coverage):**
- StorageService.uploadFile (success, virus detected, S3 failure)
- StorageService.deleteFile (success, file not found)
- StorageService.validateFile (valid images, invalid types, oversized)
- SpeakersController.uploadPhoto (success, invalid file, speaker not found)
- SpeakersService.updatePhotoUrl (success, speaker not found)
- ImageValidationPipe.transform (valid images, invalid types)

**Integration Tests:**
- Complete upload flow: POST /speakers/:id/upload-photo with valid image
- Upload with invalid file type - expect 400
- Upload with oversized file - expect 400
- Upload to non-existent speaker - expect 404
- Rate limiting test - 6 rapid uploads should trigger 429
- Legal-pages still works after migration
- Press-materials still works after migration

**Test File Locations:**
- `apps/api/tests/unit/modules/storage/storage.service.spec.ts`
- `apps/api/tests/unit/modules/storage/storage-config.service.spec.ts`
- `apps/api/tests/unit/modules/speakers/speakers.controller.spec.ts` (extend existing)
- `apps/api/tests/unit/modules/speakers/speakers.service.spec.ts` (extend existing)
- `apps/api/tests/integration/speakers-upload.spec.ts` (new)

### Security Considerations

Following security requirements from Story 2.7 and coding standards:

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- All upload endpoints require JWT authentication
- Role-based access: SUPER_ADMIN and PRODUCER only
- Use JwtAuthGuard and RolesGuard decorators

**Input Validation:**
- Validate file exists before processing
- Check MIME type against whitelist
- Validate magic bytes match declared type
- Enforce file size limits (5MB for images)
- Sanitize filename before generating S3 key

**Rate Limiting:**
- 5 uploads per minute per user
- Prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- Redis-backed for distributed systems

**Virus Scanning:**
- Scan all files before upload to S3
- Reject files that fail security checks
- Log security events for monitoring

**Data Protection:**
- Old photos remain in S3 (no automatic deletion to avoid race conditions)
- S3 lifecycle policies should be configured for cleanup of unused files
- Use signed URLs for secure downloads if needed
- Store only URLs in database, not file content
- AWS credentials accessed only through ConfigService

**Audit Trail:**
- Log all upload attempts (success and failure)
- Log security events (virus detected, rate limit exceeded)
- Include user ID in all logs for accountability

### Performance Considerations

**Upload Performance:**
- Stream files to S3 instead of loading into memory
- Use efficient magic byte checking (read first 16 bytes only)
- Virus scanning may add 1-3 seconds per file
- S3 upload typically completes in 1-5 seconds for images <5MB

**Caching:**
- No caching for upload operations (always fresh)
- S3 URLs can be cached in CDN if configured
- Rate limit state stored in Redis for fast checks

**Database Impact:**
- Single MongoDB update per upload (photoUrl field)
- Indexed speaker _id field ensures fast lookups
- No complex queries during upload flow

**Scalability:**
- Stateless upload process can scale horizontally
- S3 handles storage scaling automatically
- Redis throttler supports distributed rate limiting
- Bull queue not needed (synchronous upload acceptable)

### Frontend Integration Notes

**Current Frontend Code (apps/admin/src/services/speakers.service.ts:82-94):**
```typescript
async uploadPhoto(file: File): Promise<{ url: string }> {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);

  const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/upload/speaker-photo`, formData, {
    headers: {
      ...this.getAuthHeader(),
      'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
    },
  });
  return response.data.data || response.data;
}
```

**Required Change:**
```typescript
// Change endpoint to include speaker ID
async uploadPhoto(speakerId: string, file: File): Promise<{ url: string }> {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);

  const response = await axios.post(
    `${API_URL}/speakers/${speakerId}/upload-photo`,
    formData,
    {
      headers: {
        ...this.getAuthHeader(),
        'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
      },
    }
  );
  return response.data.data || response.data;
}
```

**Frontend Components to Update:**
- Update speaker form/dialog to pass speaker ID to uploadPhoto
- Add loading state during upload (image upload can take 2-5 seconds)
- Display error messages from API (file type, size, virus scan)
- Show success message and refresh speaker photo after upload
- Handle rate limit errors (429) with user-friendly message

### Technical Constraints

**File Size Limits:**
- Maximum 5MB for speaker photos
- Enforced at multiple layers: frontend validation, backend validation, S3 bucket policy

**Supported Image Formats:**
- JPEG (image/jpeg) - most common, good compression
- PNG (image/png) - transparency support, lossless
- WebP (image/webp) - modern format, excellent compression

**S3 Configuration:**
- Bucket must be configured for public-read or CloudFront distribution
- CORS must allow uploads from admin frontend domain
- S3 Lifecycle policy SHOULD be configured to cleanup old/unused photos:
  - Example: Delete files in speaker-photos/ not referenced by any speaker after 90 days
  - This prevents storage bloat from old photos when speakers update their images
  - Lifecycle rules run automatically and safely handle orphaned files

**Dependencies:**
- NestJS 10.0+ (existing)
- @nestjs/platform-express (existing, for FileInterceptor)
- @aws-sdk/client-s3 (existing, from legal-pages)
- AWS account with S3 bucket configured
- Optional: ClamAV server for production virus scanning

### Code Quality Standards

**TypeScript:**
- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types (use proper interfaces/types)
- All functions must have return type annotations
- Use async/await consistently, no promise chains

**NestJS Patterns:**
- Services use dependency injection
- Controllers delegate logic to services
- DTOs with class-validator decorators
- Proper module imports/exports
- Guards for authentication and authorization

**Error Handling:**
- Use NestJS exception classes (BadRequestException, etc.)
- Provide clear error messages for users
- Log errors with context for debugging
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages

**Testing:**
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies (S3, ClamAV, MongoDB)
- Test happy path and error cases
- Integration tests for critical flows

**Documentation:**
- Swagger decorators for all endpoints
- JSDoc comments for complex logic
- README in storage module explaining usage
- Migration guide for developers

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Test Location:**
- Backend unit tests: `apps/api/tests/unit/modules/storage/`, `apps/api/tests/unit/modules/speakers/`
- Backend integration tests: `apps/api/tests/integration/`
- Frontend tests: `apps/admin/tests/` (if applicable)

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Jest for unit and integration tests
- Supertest for API endpoint testing
- React Testing Library for frontend components (if needed)

**Coverage Requirements:**
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new Storage module
- 100% coverage for critical paths (file validation, virus scanning)
- All error cases must be tested

**Test Data:**
- Use mock image files for testing (JPEG, PNG, WebP)

3. Upload valid WebP image - expect success
4. Upload invalid file type (PDF) - expect 400 error
5. Upload oversized file (>5MB) - expect 400 error
6. Upload to non-existent speaker - expect 404 error
7. Upload triggers virus detection - expect 400 error
8. Rate limiting after 5 uploads - expect 429 error
9. S3 upload fails - expect 500 error
10. Speaker photoUrl updated correctly after upload
11. Legal-pages upload still works after migration

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation Quality: EXCELLENT**

The implementation of Story 2.8 demonstrates strong software engineering practices and successfully delivers all acceptance criteria. The centralized Storage module is well-architected with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive validation, and security-first design.

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ **Excellent Architecture**: Clean module structure with StorageService, VirusScannerService, and StorageConfigService properly separated
- ✅ **Strong Security**: Multi-layered validation (MIME type, magic bytes, file size, virus scanning), JWT auth, role-based access, rate limiting
- ✅ **Successful Migration**: Legal-pages and press-materials successfully migrated to use centralized Storage module
- ✅ **Comprehensive Validation**: Magic bytes validation for all supported formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, PDF) with special handling for WebP RIFF format
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Proper error handling, logging, AWS credential management via ConfigService
- ✅ **Code Reusability**: FileCategory enum and configurable upload options enable easy extension for new file types

**Areas Requiring Attention:**
- ⚠️ **Test Coverage Gap**: No unit tests found for StorageService, VirusScannerService, or speaker upload endpoint
- ⚠️ **Integration Testing**: Missing integration test for complete upload flow
- ℹ️ **Documentation**: Could benefit from Storage module README explaining usage patterns for developers

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/api/src/modules/storage/services/virus-scanner.service.ts:162`
  - **Change**: Added `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-var-requires` before `require('net')` statement
  - **Why**: ClamAV scanning requires dynamic net module import; static import not appropriate here
  - **How**: Suppresses linter warning with inline comment explaining necessity

- **File**: `apps/api/src/modules/storage/services/virus-scanner.service.ts:232`
  - **Change**: Renamed unused parameter `mimeType` to `_mimeType` in `performHeuristicScanning` method

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1: Speaker Photo Upload Endpoint**
- Given: An authenticated admin/producer with a valid speaker ID
- When: They POST a multipart/form-data file to `/speakers/:id/upload-photo`
- Then: File is validated, scanned, uploaded to S3, and URL is saved to speaker record
- **Implementation**: `speakers.controller.ts:233-296`, `speakers.service.ts:185-204`
- **Test Coverage**: ✗ No integration test found

**AC2: File Type Validation**
- Given: A file is uploaded for speaker photo
- When: The file MIME type is checked
- Then: Only JPEG, PNG, WebP are accepted; others rejected with 400 error
- **Implementation**: `storage.service.ts:162-168`, magic bytes validation at `storage.service.ts:171-176`
- **Test Coverage**: ✗ No unit test found

**AC3: File Size Validation**
- Given: A speaker photo file is uploaded
- When: File size exceeds 5MB (5 * 1024 * 1024 bytes)
- Then: Request is rejected with 400 error indicating max size
- **Implementation**: `storage.service.ts:157-160`, category defaults at `storage.service.ts:49-51`
- **Test Coverage**: ✗ No unit test found

**AC4: Virus Scanning Integration**
- Given: A file is uploaded
- When: Virus scanning is enabled (via VIRUS_SCANNING_ENABLED env var)
- Then: File is scanned with ClamAV if configured, or heuristic checks, rejected if threat detected
- **Implementation**: `virus-scanner.service.ts:18-49`, `storage.service.ts:111-113`
- **Test Coverage**: ✗ No unit test found

**AC5: S3 Upload and URL Return**
- Given: A valid speaker photo passes all validation
- When: StorageService.uploadFile is called
- Then: File uploaded to S3 with unique key, public URL returned and saved to speaker.photoUrl
- **Implementation**: `storage.service.ts:86-142`, `speakers.service.ts:196-203`
- **Test Coverage**: ✗ No unit test with S3 mock found

**AC6: Centralized Storage Module**
- Given: Multiple modules need file upload functionality
- When: StorageModule is imported
- Then: StorageService provides unified interface for S3 operations with validation and scanning
- **Implementation**: `storage.module.ts:1-12`, clean architecture with service separation
- **Test Coverage**: ✗ No module test found

**AC7: Migration of Existing Modules**
- Given: Legal-pages and press-materials have S3 upload code
- When: Modules are migrated to use StorageService
- Then: Old S3StorageService is deprecated, both modules use centralized service
- **Implementation**:
  - Legal-pages: `legal-pages.service.ts:100-107`, `legal-pages.module.ts` imports StorageModule
  - Press-materials: `file-upload.service.ts:22-33`, `press-materials.module.ts` imports StorageModule
- **Test Coverage**: ⚠️ Migration completed but existing tests not verified

**AC8: Rate Limiting (Throttling)**
- Given: A user attempts multiple rapid uploads
- When: More than 5 uploads in 60 seconds are attempted
- Then: Request is rejected with 429 error
- **Implementation**: `speakers.controller.ts:237` `@Throttle({ default: { limit: 5, ttl: 60000 } })`
- **Test Coverage**: ✗ No rate limiting test found

### Security Review

**✓ PASSED - Strong Security Implementation**

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- ✅ JWT authentication required (`@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)`)
- ✅ Role-based access control (SUPER_ADMIN, PRODUCER only)
- ✅ Speaker existence verified before upload
- ✅ AWS credentials accessed only through ConfigService (never hardcoded)

**Input Validation:**
- ✅ File existence and non-empty checks
- ✅ MIME type whitelist validation
- ✅ Magic bytes validation (defense against MIME type spoofing)
- ✅ File size limits enforced (5MB for images, 10MB for documents)
- ✅ Filename sanitization in key generation
- ✅ WebP special validation (RIFF header + WEBP marker)

**Virus Scanning:**
- ✅ Integrated with ClamAV when configured
- ✅ Heuristic scanning fallback with obfuscation detection
- ✅ Embedded script detection in images (script tags, javascript:, onerror)
- ✅ PDF dangerous content detection (/JavaScript, /Launch, /EmbeddedFile)
- ✅ Excessive metadata checks for hidden payloads
- ✅ Fail-safe approach: reject on scan failure

**Rate Limiting:**
- ✅ Throttle decorator limiting 5 uploads per minute
- ✅ Redis-backed for distributed systems
- ✅ Prevents DoS attacks and abuse

**Data Protection:**
- ✅ Old photos not automatically deleted (prevents race conditions)
- ✅ S3 keys use timestamp + random for uniqueness
- ✅ Only URLs stored in database, not file content
- ✅ Proper error messages without sensitive info exposure

**Audit & Logging:**
- ✅ All upload attempts logged (success and failure)
- ✅ Security events logged (virus detected, rate limit exceeded)
- ✅ User context included in logs via userId parameter

**Potential Improvements:**
- Consider adding file hash calculation and duplicate detection
- Consider implementing signed URLs for speaker photo downloads if photos become private
- Document S3 bucket CORS and lifecycle policies in README

### Performance Considerations

**✓ PASSED - Efficient Implementation**

**Upload Performance:**
- ✅ Streaming to S3 via Buffer (no intermediate file writes)
- ✅ Magic bytes check reads only first 16 bytes (efficient)
- ✅ Single MongoDB update per upload (minimal DB impact)
- ⚠️ Virus scanning adds 1-3 seconds per file (acceptable trade-off for security)
- ⚠️ S3 upload synchronous (acceptable for images <5MB; async queue not needed)

**Scalability:**
- ✅ Stateless upload process supports horizontal scaling
- ✅ S3 handles storage scaling automatically
- ✅ Redis throttler supports distributed rate limiting
- ✅ No file system dependencies (all in-memory or S3)

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Consider caching categoryDefaults (currently recreated on each upload)
- Consider parallel validation and virus scanning if both are expensive
- Monitor S3 upload times and consider CDN for faster photo delivery

### Files Modified During Review

**Modified During QA Review:**
- `apps/api/src/modules/storage/services/virus-scanner.service.ts` (linter fixes)

**Note to Dev:** Please update the File List in Dev Agent Record to include this QA review change if you agree with the modifications.

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed During Review:**
- [x] Fixed linter warning for require('net') statement with eslint-disable comment
- [x] Fixed unused parameter warning by prefixing with underscore
- [x] Comprehensive code review and security audit completed

**Required Before Production:**
- [ ] Add unit tests for StorageService (uploadFile, validateFile, deleteFile, getSignedUrl, getFile, getFileMetadata)
- [ ] Add unit tests for VirusScannerService (scanFile, ClamAV integration, heuristic scanning, error cases)
- [ ] Add unit tests for SpeakersController.uploadPhoto endpoint
- [ ] Add integration test for complete speaker photo upload flow
- [ ] Verify legal-pages tests still pass after migration
- [ ] Verify press-materials tests still pass after migration
- [ ] Add test for rate limiting (6 rapid uploads should trigger 429)
- [ ] Add test for file type validation (reject PDF upload for speaker photo)
- [ ] Add test for file size validation (reject 6MB file for speaker photo)
- [ ] Add test for virus detection scenario

**Recommended for Future:**
- [ ] Create Storage module README with usage examples and architecture documentation
- [ ] Document S3 bucket configuration requirements (CORS, lifecycle policies, IAM permissions)
- [ ] Add monitoring/alerting for virus scan failures and S3 upload errors
- [ ] Consider adding file hash calculation for duplicate detection
- [ ] Consider performance optimization: cache category defaults

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → `docs/qa/gates/2.8-speaker-photo-upload-with-centralized-storage.yml`

**Rationale:** Implementation is production-ready from a functionality and security perspective. All acceptance criteria are met with excellent code quality. However, the complete absence of tests for the new Storage module and speaker upload endpoint creates significant risk for regression and maintainability. Tests are critical before this can be marked as "Done."

**Quality Score:** 70/100
- Deduction: -30 points for missing test coverage (3 medium severity issues × 10 points each)

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Add Comprehensive Test Coverage**

**Priority: HIGH** - Tests must be added before marking story as Done.

**Reasoning:**
- Functionality is complete and meets all ACs
- Code quality is excellent with proper architecture
- Security implementation is strong
- Migration completed successfully
- **However:** Lack of tests creates unacceptable risk for production deployment

**Next Steps:**
1. Add unit tests for Storage module services (StorageService, VirusScannerService)
2. Add integration test for speaker photo upload endpoint
3. Run and verify existing tests for legal-pages and press-materials
4. Re-run QA review after tests are added (expect PASS gate)

**Note to Dev:** The core implementation is excellent. Once tests are added, this story will easily achieve a PASS gate. Consider this a success with one critical gap to address.
