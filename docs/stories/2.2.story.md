## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 2.1:
- Admin app structure established with React + TypeScript + Vite
- Authentication and protected routes implemented
- Base layout with sidebar navigation ready
- Zustand store pattern established
- API service with JWT token handling configured
- Testing setup with Vitest and React Testing Library

### Speaker Data Model
[Source: packages/shared/src/types/speaker.types.ts]
```typescript
interface Speaker extends BaseEntity {
  name: string;
  bio: {
    'pt-BR': string;
    'en': string;
  };
  photoUrl: string;
  company: string;
  position: {
    'pt-BR': string;
    'en': string;
  };
  socialLinks: {
    linkedin?: string;
    twitter?: string;
    instagram?: string;
    github?: string;
    website?: string;
  };
  priority: number;
  isHighlight: boolean;
  isVisible: boolean;
}
```

### API Endpoints
[Source: Swagger documentation from Story 1.5]
- GET /speakers - List with pagination, search, filters
  - Query params: page, limit, sort, search, company, isHighlight
  - Response includes metadata with pagination info
- GET /speakers/:id - Get single speaker
- POST /speakers - Create new speaker (requires auth)
- PUT /speakers/:id - Update speaker (requires auth)
- DELETE /speakers/:id - Soft delete (requires auth)

### UI Components to Use
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - shadcn/ui]
- Table - For speakers listing
- Dialog - For add/edit form
- Form - With react-hook-form integration
- Input, Textarea - Form fields
- Switch - For boolean toggles
- Tabs - For multilingual content
- Button - Actions
- AlertDialog - Delete confirmation
- Badge - Status indicators
- Card - Container components
- Toast - Notifications

### File Structure
[Source: Story 2.1 established structure]
```
apps/admin/src/
├── pages/
│   └── Speakers.tsx
├── components/
│   └── speakers/
│       ├── SpeakersList.tsx
│       ├── SpeakerForm.tsx

│       └── ImageUpload.tsx
├── services/
│   └── speakers.service.ts
└── types/
    └── speaker.types.ts (import from shared)
```

### Form Validation Schema
```typescript
const speakerSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(3).max(100),
  bio: z.object({
    'pt-BR': z.string().min(10),
    'en': z.string().min(10)
  }),
  company: z.string().max(100),
  position: z.object({
    'pt-BR': z.string(),
    'en': z.string()
  }),
  photoUrl: z.string().url(),
  socialLinks: z.object({
    linkedin: z.string().url().optional(),
    twitter: z.string().optional(),
    instagram: z.string().optional(),
    github: z.string().url().optional(),
    website: z.string().url().optional()
  }),
  priority: z.number().min(0).max(999),
  isHighlight: z.boolean(),
  isVisible: z.boolean()
});
```

### Pagination Implementation
[Source: Backend response format from Story 1.4]
```typescript
interface PaginatedResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data: T[];
  metadata: {
    total: number;
    page: number;
    limit: number;
    hasNext: boolean;
    hasPrev: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Image Upload Considerations
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Accepted formats: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp
- Recommended dimensions: 400x400px (square)
- Use FormData for multipart upload
- Show progress during upload
- Compress images client-side if needed

### Multilingual Support
Note: Epic mentions PT/EN/ES support, but current Speaker type only has pt-BR and en. Implement with existing two languages for now, structure allows easy addition of 'es' field later.

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

#### Test Files Location
```
apps/admin/tests/
├── unit/
│   └── components/
│       ├── speakers/
│       │   ├── SpeakersList.test.tsx
│       │   ├── SpeakerForm.test.tsx
│       │   └── ImageUpload.test.tsx
└── integration/
    └── services/
        └── speakers.service.test.ts
```

#### Testing Patterns
- Mock API responses with MSW or Vitest mocks
- Test form validation with invalid/valid data
- Test pagination controls and state
- Test image upload with mock files
- Test error states and loading states
- Verify accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)

## Status
Ready for Review

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates good React patterns with proper component separation and state management. The speaker management feature is well-structured with comprehensive CRUD operations, multilingual support, and appropriate UI feedback mechanisms. However, a critical authentication bug was discovered and fixed during review.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/admin/src/services/speakers.service.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed token retrieval from localStorage
  - **Why**: Critical authentication bug - service was looking for 'token' instead of 'access_token'
  - **How**: Aligned token key with API service standard ('access_token'), ensuring proper authentication

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows React/TypeScript best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper component organization and service layer separation
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests cover components, integration tests for services
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed authentication token inconsistency bug (speakers.service.ts:29)
- [ ] Remove console.log/console.error statements in production code (7 occurrences)
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries for component error handling
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed API requests
- [ ] Add image optimization/compression before upload
- [ ] Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large speaker lists
- [ ] Add telemetry/monitoring for upload failures

### Security Review

**Found Issues:**
1. **FIXED** - Critical: Token key mismatch causing potential authentication failures
2. Minor: Console statements may leak sensitive information in production
3. Minor: No rate limiting on image uploads (potential DoS vector)

**Recommendations:**
- Implement rate limiting for upload endpoints
- Add Content Security Policy headers
- Sanitize user inputs in URL handling

### Performance Considerations

1. **Image Loading**: No lazy loading implemented for speaker photos in list view
2. **Search Debounce**: Properly implemented with 500ms delay ✓
3. **Pagination**: Correctly implemented with server-side pagination ✓
4. **Bundle Size**: Consider dynamic imports for heavy components (image upload)

### Files Modified During Review

- apps/admin/src/services/speakers.service.ts (Fixed authentication token bug)

### Test Coverage Analysis

**Strengths:**
- Good unit test coverage for components (SpeakersList, SpeakerForm, ImageUpload)
- Proper mocking of external services
- Edge cases tested (file size validation, format validation)

**Gaps:**
- Missing tests for error scenarios in API calls
- No tests for concurrent edit scenarios
- Missing accessibility (a11y) tests
- No performance tests for large datasets

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/2.2-gestao-de-palestrantes.yml
Risk profile: Low-Medium (authentication bug fixed, minor issues remain)
NFR assessment: PASS with minor recommendations

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done (Critical bug fixed, remaining issues are minor and non-blocking)

### Notes for Team

The critical authentication bug has been resolved. The remaining console.log statements and performance optimizations can be addressed in a future iteration as they don't impact core functionality. The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with good test coverage and proper error handling.
