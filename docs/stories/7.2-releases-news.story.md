# User Story: Releases/News Management System

## Story
**As a** marketing team member,
**I want** a comprehensive system to manage news releases and announcements,
**So that** I can publish multilingual content with rich media to keep stakeholders informed about event updates

## Background
The VTEX Day 2026 platform requires a robust news and releases management system to publish announcements, updates, and press releases in multiple languages (pt-BR, en, es). This module must support rich content with image galleries, proper content moderation, and publication scheduling. Based on lessons learned from the Press Materials module (stories 7.1.1 and 7.1.2), this implementation will proactively address security vulnerabilities, implement proper input sanitization, and include comprehensive testing from the start.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context
**Backend Stack:**
- NestJS framework with modular architecture
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- AWS S3 for image storage
- Sharp for image processing
- DOMPurify for HTML sanitization
- node-cron for scheduled publishing
- RSS/Atom feed libraries

**Frontend Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Shadcn/ui components
- React Query for data fetching
- TinyMCE or Quill for rich text editing
- React Dropzone for file uploads
- React Window for virtualization
- Day.js for date handling

### Security Considerations (CRITICAL - Based on QA Findings)
1. **Input Sanitization**: ALL text inputs must be sanitized using DOMPurify
2. **File Validation**: Implement both client and server-side validation
3. **Rate Limiting**: Configure per-endpoint limits:
   - Public read: 100 req/min
   - Admin write: 20 req/min
   - Upload: 10 req/min
4. **No prompt()**: Use proper modal components for all user inputs
5. **Memory Management**: Properly revoke all object URLs
6. **Path Traversal**: Sanitize all file paths

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The News Releases module demonstrates **solid architecture** with comprehensive functionality and good TypeScript type safety. The implementation follows modern patterns with proper separation of concerns, modular service design, and reactive frontend components. However, **critical security vulnerabilities** were identified that must be addressed before production deployment.

**Overall Rating: B+ (Good with Critical Issues)**

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/api/src/modules/news-releases/utils/sanitization.util.ts`
  - **Change**: Hardened DOMPurify configuration to remove dangerous attributes
  - **Why**: Current configuration allows `data-*`, `style`, and `id` attributes that can enable XSS attacks
  - **How**: Restricted to safe attributes only (href, target, src, alt, width, height, title)

- **File**: `apps/api/src/modules/news-releases/services/image-processing.service.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed unsafe URL parsing with proper URL validation
  - **Why**: Naive string splitting vulnerable to path traversal attacks
  - **How**: Implemented secure URL parsing with validation and sanitization

- **File**: `apps/api/src/modules/news-releases/dto/image-upload.dto.ts`
  - **Change**: Added JSON schema validation to Transform decorator
  - **Why**: Unvalidated JSON parsing can lead to injection attacks and prototype pollution
  - **How**: Added validation and error handling for parsed JSON metadata

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent TypeScript usage, consistent patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper modular architecture following NestJS conventions
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Missing integration tests, security tests, frontend tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All functional requirements implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Hardened DOMPurify configuration to prevent XSS (`utils/sanitization.util.ts`)
- [x] Fixed image URL parsing vulnerability (`services/image-processing.service.ts`)
- [x] Added JSON validation for image metadata (`dto/image-upload.dto.ts`)
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large lists in admin interface
- [ ] Add comprehensive security test suite
- [ ] Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Add frontend component tests with React Testing Library
- [ ] Implement proper memory management for blob URLs
- [ ] Add MongoDB text indexes for performance
- [ ] Implement error boundaries in React components
- [ ] Add accessibility tests (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

### Security Review

**Critical Vulnerabilities Found (Now Fixed):**
1. **XSS Risk**: DOMPurify allowed dangerous attributes - **FIXED**
2. **Path Traversal**: Weak URL parsing in image service - **FIXED**
3. **JSON Injection**: Unvalidated JSON parsing - **FIXED**

**Well-Implemented Security:**
- ✓ JWT authentication with role-based access control
- ✓ Rate limiting properly configured per endpoint
- ✓ File upload validation (size, MIME type)
- ✓ Comprehensive input validation with DTOs

### Performance Considerations

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Sequential Image Uploads**: Current implementation blocks UI during multiple uploads
   - Recommendation: Implement parallel upload with Promise.all()
2. **Memory Leaks**: Missing URL.revokeObjectURL() for preview URLs
   - Recommendation: Add cleanup in useEffect return
3. **Inefficient Search**: Regex search on large content fields without indexes
   - Recommendation: Add MongoDB text indexes or implement Elasticsearch

**Performance Strengths:**
- Proper pagination with limits
- Lazy loading strategy for images
- Good caching strategy for public endpoints

### Files Modified During Review

1. `apps/api/src/modules/news-releases/utils/sanitization.util.ts` - Security hardening
2. `apps/api/src/modules/news-releases/services/image-processing.service.ts` - URL parsing fix
3. `apps/api/src/modules/news-releases/dto/image-upload.dto.ts` - JSON validation

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/7.2-releases-news.yml
Risk profile: High risk due to security vulnerabilities (now mitigated)
NFR assessment: Security PASS (after fixes), Performance CONCERNS, Reliability PASS

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]
(Story owner decides final status)

**Priority Actions Before Production:**
1. Add comprehensive test coverage (integration, security, frontend)
2. Implement performance optimizations (virtual scrolling, parallel uploads)
3. Add error boundaries for crash protection
4. Verify security fixes with penetration testing

### Review Date: 2025-09-28 (Update)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

After thorough analysis of the actual implementation files, the News Releases module demonstrates **excellent security practices** with comprehensive protection against common vulnerabilities. Previous concerns have been addressed, and the implementation shows mature security architecture.

**Overall Rating: A- (Excellent with Minor Improvements Needed)**

### Comprehensive Security Analysis

**Security Strengths Found:**
- **XSS Prevention**: DOMPurify with strict whitelist configuration in `sanitization.util.ts`
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive class-validator decorators with size limits and type checking
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Multiple layers of defense including pattern removal and validation
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based access control (ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN)
- **Rate Limiting**: Strategic throttling - Write: 20/60s, Public: 100/60s, Upload: 10/60s

**Medium Risk Issues Identified:**
1. **File Upload Security**: MIME type validation exists but lacks magic number verification
2. **MongoDB Query Injection**: Search regex without proper escaping (Line 127-137 in service)
3. **URL Validation**: Basic validation without SSRF protection

### Test Coverage Review

**Backend Testing (EXCELLENT)**
- **Integration Tests**: 550 lines covering auth, validation, XSS, rate limiting
- **Security Tests**: 407 lines of dedicated security testing
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive edge cases and attack vectors

**Frontend Testing (MODERATE)**
- Limited security testing for client-side sanitization
- Missing tests for rich text editor XSS prevention

### Performance Analysis

**Optimizations Implemented:**
- **Database**: Comprehensive indexing with compound and text indexes
- **Images**: Sharp optimization, multiple sizes, CDN integration
- **Caching**: Proper headers and strategy for public endpoints

**Performance Concerns:**
1. **Bulk Operations**: Promise.all without concurrency control
2. **Memory Management**: Preview URLs cleanup depends on upload success
3. **Search Performance**: Could benefit from Elasticsearch for large datasets
