# User Story: Public Sponsors Display in Mobile App

## Story

**As a** event attendee using the mobile app,
**I want** to view event sponsors organized by tiers and access their details,
**so that** I can learn about sponsors and visit their booths or websites.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing Sponsors module in NestJS backend
- Technology: NestJS (backend), React Native/Expo (mobile), MongoDB, TypeScript
- Follows pattern: `/api/event-settings/public` endpoint pattern (public route with filtered data)
- Touch points:
  - Backend: `apps/api/src/modules/sponsors/` (controller, service, schemas)
  - Mobile: `apps/mobile/src/screens/Home/HomeScreen.tsx` (already has sponsors button)
  - Shared types: `packages/shared/src/types/sponsor.types.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Backend creates public endpoint `GET /api/sponsors/public` that:
   - Returns only sponsors where `isVisible: true`
   - Excludes sensitive fields (`postsUsed`, `maxPosts`)
   - Uses `@Public()` decorator (no authentication required)
   - Returns sponsors with pagination support

2. Backend creates public endpoint `GET /api/sponsors/public/grouped-by-tier` that:
   - Returns sponsors grouped by tier (ordered by tier priority)
   - Only includes sponsors where `isVisible: true`
   - Excludes sensitive fields (`postsUsed`, `maxPosts`)
   - Uses `@Public()` decorator

3. Mobile app implements sponsors listing screen that:
   - Displays sponsors grouped by tier
   - Shows tier name and sponsors within each tier
   - Each sponsor card shows: logo, name, tier badge
   - Tapping a sponsor navigates to details screen

4. Mobile app implements sponsor details screen that:
   - Displays full sponsor information: logo, name, description (localized), website, social links, stand location
   - Provides clickable links for website and social media
   - Shows tier information
   - Has back navigation to listing

5. Home screen integration:
   - Existing "Patrocinadores" button navigates to sponsors listing screen
   - Navigation route named 'Sponsors' (already configured in HomeScreen.tsx:57)

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing sponsors admin functionality continues to work unchanged
7. New public endpoints follow existing API response pattern (`ApiResponse.success()`)
8. Mobile screens follow existing patterns (similar to Sessions, Speakers screens)

**Quality Requirements:**

9. Backend endpoints include Swagger documentation
10. Mobile screens include loading states and error handling
11. Mobile service includes proper TypeScript typing
12. No regression in existing sponsors CRUD functionality

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:**
  - Backend: Add new public methods to `SponsorsService` and new routes to `SponsorsController`
  - Create DTO for public sponsor response that excludes sensitive fields
  - Mobile: Create `SponsorsService.ts` following pattern from `EventSettingsService.ts`
  - Create screens in `apps/mobile/src/screens/Sponsors/`

- **Existing Pattern Reference:**
  - Public endpoint pattern: See `apps/api/src/modules/event-settings/` (has `/public` route)
  - Mobile service pattern: See `apps/mobile/src/services/EventSettingsService.ts`
  - Mobile screen pattern: See `apps/mobile/src/screens/Sessions/` or `apps/mobile/src/screens/Speakers/`

- **Key Constraints:**
  - Must filter by `isVisible: true` at database query level (not in code)
  - Must exclude sensitive fields in DTO transformation
  - Mobile screens must support both pt-BR and en locales
  - Follow React Native best practices (SafeAreaView, proper navigation)

## Definition of Done

- [x] Public endpoints created and tested
- [x] Swagger documentation added for new endpoints
- [x] Mobile service created with TypeScript types
- [x] Sponsors listing screen implemented with tier grouping
- [x] Sponsor details screen implemented
- [x] Navigation wired from Home → Sponsors → Details
- [x] Loading and error states handled
- [x] Existing sponsors admin functionality verified (no regression)
- [x] Manual testing on iOS/Android simulators passes
- [x] Code follows project coding standards

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Exposing sensitive sponsor data through public endpoint
- **Mitigation:** Explicitly exclude `postsUsed` and `maxPosts` fields in response DTO; add integration test to verify fields are not exposed
- **Rollback:** Remove public routes from controller; mobile app will show error state

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing sponsors APIs (new routes only)
- [x] Database changes: None (uses existing `isVisible` field)
- [x] UI changes follow existing mobile app design patterns
- [x] Performance impact: Minimal (simple query with index on `isVisible`)

- Test framework: Jest + Supertest
- Must test:
  - Only `isVisible: true` sponsors returned
  - Sensitive fields NOT in response
  - Tier grouping and ordering correct
  - Public decorator allows unauthenticated access

**Mobile Testing:**
- Test file location: `apps/mobile/src/services/__tests__/SponsorsService.test.ts`
- Test framework: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- Must test:
  - Service correctly fetches from public endpoints
  - Proper error handling
  - TypeScript types are correct

### Important Notes from Architecture

- **API Response Pattern:** All API responses must use `ApiResponse.success(data, metadata?)` wrapper
- **Error Handling:** Mobile services must catch errors and return structured error objects
- **Localization:** Use device locale to select appropriate language from multilingual fields
- **Public Routes:** Use `@Public()` decorator from `@common/decorators/public.decorator`
- **Navigation:** Register screens in `AppNavigator.tsx` within appropriate stack navigator

## QA Results

**Review Date:** 2025-10-01 (Updated)
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)
**Gate Decision:** ✅ **PASS with CONCERNS** - Critical issues fixed, medium priority improvements recommended

### Risk Summary

- **Critical Risks:** 0 (SEC-001: ✅ FIXED)
- **High Risks:** 0 (PERF-001: ✅ FIXED)
- **Medium Risks:** 3 (field consistency, rate limiting, locale detection)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 82/100 (Low Risk)

### Fixed Critical/High Issues ✅

#### 1. SEC-001: Internal `isVisible` Field Exposed to Public API ✅ RESOLVED
**Severity:** Critical (Score 9) → **FIXED**
**Location:** `apps/api/src/modules/sponsors/sponsors.service.ts:370,397`

**Resolution Applied:**
- ✅ Added `-isVisible` to `.select()` exclusion at lines 370 and 397
- ✅ Updated integration tests to verify `isVisible` is undefined (lines 131, 217)
- ✅ Updated mobile test mocks to remove `isVisible` field
- ✅ Field now properly excluded from public API responses

**Verification:**
```typescript
// Applied fix:
.select('-maxPosts -postsUsed -adminEmail -isVisible -deletedAt -deletedBy -deleteReason -__v')

// Test now asserts:
expect(sponsor.isVisible).toBeUndefined(); // ✅
```

---

#### 2. PERF-001: Missing Composite Index for Public Queries ✅ RESOLVED
**Severity:** High (Score 6) → **FIXED**
**Location:** `apps/api/src/modules/sponsors/schemas/sponsor.schema.ts:173`

**Resolution Applied:**
- ✅ Added composite index: `{ isVisible: 1, deletedAt: 1, tier: 1, orderInTier: 1 }`
- ✅ Query will now use optimized index for `{isVisible: true, deletedAt: null}` pattern
- ✅ Expected performance: <100ms p95 for 1000+ sponsors

**Verification:**
```typescript
// Composite index added at line 173:
SponsorSchema.index({ isVisible: 1, deletedAt: 1, tier: 1, orderInTier: 1 });
```

---

### Medium Priority Issues ⚠️

1. **TECH-001:** Inconsistent field exclusion patterns across endpoints
2. **OPS-001:** No rate limiting on public endpoints (recommended: 100 req/min)
3. **BUS-001:** Locale detection not implemented in mobile UI (TODO at SponsorsListScreen.tsx:64)

### Resolved Items ✅

- **DATA-001:** Mobile service unit tests created at `apps/mobile/tests/unit/services/SponsorsService.test.ts` with comprehensive coverage

### Testing Status

✅ **Completed:**
1. Security fix verified: `isVisible` excluded from public API
2. Integration tests updated to verify field exclusion
3. Mobile service tests comprehensive (293 lines)

⚠️ **Recommended (Post-Launch):**
1. Load testing for performance at scale (1000+ sponsors)
2. E2E tests for deep linking (manual testing completed)
3. Security penetration testing

### Recommendations

**Completed Fixes:** ✅
1. ✅ SEC-001 FIXED: `isVisible` field excluded from public responses
2. ✅ PERF-001 FIXED: Composite index added for query optimization
3. ✅ Integration tests updated to verify field exclusion

**Post-Launch Improvements:**
- Add centralized `PUBLIC_SPONSOR_SELECT` constant for consistency
- Implement rate limiting on public endpoints
- Complete locale detection in mobile UI
- Add performance monitoring and alerts
