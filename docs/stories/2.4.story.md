        ├── sponsors.service.test.ts
        └── user-accounts.service.test.ts
```

Testing patterns:
- Mock API responses with MSW or vi.mock
- Test drag-and-drop with testing-library/user-event
- Test form validation with invalid/valid data
- Test logo upload with mock File objects
- Test tier-sponsor relationships and ordering
- Test user account creation workflow
- Verify error states and loading states
- Ensure accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md + patterns from previous stories]
- Logo file size limit: 5MB maximum
- Supported formats: jpg, png, svg, webp
- Automatic logo optimization/compression required
- Response time <200ms for list queries
- Implement debounce on search (500ms)
- Validate email addresses for admin and contact emails
- Sanitize website URLs and social links
- Implement optimistic UI updates for ordering
- Cache tier data for sponsor form dropdown

### Specific Implementation Notes
- **Tier Ordering:** Must support both inter-tier ordering (tier 1, 2, 3) and intra-tier ordering (sponsors within tier)
- **Posts Inheritance:** Sponsors inherit maxPosts from tier but can be overridden individually
- **User Account Creation:** Must generate secure passwords and send welcome emails
- **Logo Upload:** Consider implementing image compression client-side before upload
- **Social Links Validation:** Validate LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook URL formats
- **Stand Location:** Free text field for physical event space management

### Error Handling Considerations
- Handle failed user account creation gracefully
- Provide rollback for failed ordering operations
- Validate tier dependencies before deletion
- Handle logo upload failures with retry options
- Show clear error messages for validation failures
- Implement conflict resolution for concurrent ordering changes

## Testing

### Test File Locations

- Unit tests: `apps/admin/tests/unit/components/`
- Integration tests: `apps/admin/tests/integration/services/`
- Follow 60/30/10 split for unit/integration/e2e tests

### Testing Standards
- Use Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Mock external dependencies with MSW or vi.mock
- Test components with React Testing Library
- Test drag-and-drop interactions with user-event
- Include tests for loading, error, and success states
- Test form validation with multiple invalid scenarios
- Verify API error handling and retry logic

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation Quality:** Good architectural foundation with comprehensive feature implementation. The sponsor management system demonstrates solid design patterns, proper form validation, and modern React practices. However, critical issues exist that prevent production readiness.

**Key Strengths:**
- Well-structured component hierarchy following established patterns
- Comprehensive form validation with zod schemas
- Proper TypeScript usage with shared type definitions
- Good separation of concerns between services, components, and types
- User-friendly features like drag-and-drop logo upload with image optimization
- Multilingual support implementation

**Critical Concerns:**
- **Build Failures:** 38+ TypeScript compilation errors prevent deployment
- **Test Infrastructure Broken:** All test suites failing due to missing dependencies
- **Incomplete Implementation:** Tasks 6-7 remain unfinished (bulk actions, comprehensive testing)
- **Mock Implementation:** Logo upload service uses mock upload functionality

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring performed due to build failures.** The existing TypeScript compilation errors must be resolved before any code modifications can be safely made.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ✗ Multiple TypeScript violations, unused imports, type errors
- **Project Structure:** ✓ Files follow established directory conventions
- **Testing Strategy:** ✗ No tests exist for sponsor functionality, existing test infrastructure broken
- **All ACs Met:** ✗ Tasks 6-7 incomplete, core testing requirements unmet

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production):**
- [ ] Resolve 38+ TypeScript compilation errors across sessions, UI components, and shared types
- [ ] Fix broken test infrastructure (missing @testing-library/dom dependency)
- [ ] Implement missing sponsor-specific test suites as outlined in Tasks 6-7
- [ ] Replace mock logo upload implementation with real file upload service
- [ ] Complete Task 6: sponsor management actions (bulk operations, status management)
- [ ] Complete Task 7: comprehensive test coverage for all sponsor functionality

**Code Quality Issues:**
- [ ] Fix unused imports and variables in SessionForm component
- [ ] Resolve implicit 'any' type errors in form field handlers
- [ ] Fix type conflicts in UI components (badge, button, popover)
- [ ] Add proper type annotations for drag-and-drop field components
- [ ] Resolve verbatimModuleSyntax violations in shared types

**Architecture Improvements:**
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries for sponsor management components
- [ ] Add loading states and optimistic updates for drag-and-drop ordering
- [ ] Implement proper image upload progress tracking
- [ ] Add proper caching strategy for sponsor tier data

### Security Review

**Security Concerns Identified:**
- **File Upload Security:** Logo upload lacks server-side validation, no malware scanning
- **Input Validation:** Client-side only validation for URLs and emails - needs server-side enforcement
- **Password Generation:** Temporary password generation should be server-side for better entropy
- **Data Exposure:** No sanitization of sponsor data in API responses

**Recommendations:**
- Implement server-side file type validation and size limits
- Add server-side input sanitization for all sponsor fields
- Move password generation to secure server environment
- Implement proper RBAC for sponsor management operations

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Issues Found:**
- **Image Processing:** Client-side image resizing may impact browser performance on large files
- **Missing Optimization:** No lazy loading for sponsor lists or images
- **Network Calls:** Potential N+1 queries when loading sponsors with tier information
- **Memory Leaks:** Blob URLs in LogoUpload component not properly cleaned up

**Recommendations:**
- Implement server-side image processing and CDN integration
- Add virtualization for large sponsor lists
- Optimize API calls with proper pagination and filtering
- Implement proper cleanup for blob URLs and event listeners

### Files Modified During Review

**No files modified** - Build errors prevent safe refactoring. All modifications deferred until TypeScript compilation issues resolved.
